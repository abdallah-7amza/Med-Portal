    {
      "stem": "All of the following are presentations of CHPS except:",
      "options": [
        "Bile stained vomiting.",
        "Loss of weight in 1st 4 weeks of life.",
        "Olive like mass in right upper abdomen.",
        "Visible peristalsis."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (CHPS) involves the thickening of the pylorus muscle, which is located before the entry of the bile duct into the duodenum. Therefore, the obstruction is proximal to bile flow, and the vomit is characteristically non-bilious."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The most diagnostic investigation of CHPS is:",
      "options": [
        "Abdominal US.",

        "Barium meal.",
        "None of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Abdominal ultrasound is the investigation of choice for CHPS. It is non-invasive and can directly visualize the thickened pyloric muscle, confirming the diagnosis with high accuracy."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The surgical treatment of CHPS is:",
      "options": [
        "Gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy.",
        "Ramsted's operation.",
        "Hiller's operation.",
        "None of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The standard surgical treatment for CHPS is Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy, an operation that involves incising the hypertrophied pyloric muscle to relieve the obstruction."

        "X-ray films show gas under the diaphragm."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A perforated duodenal ulcer typically causes a sudden onset of severe, constant, and generalized pain in the upper abdomen. Colicky (cramping) pain in the lower abdomen is not a characteristic feature."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The most common site of peptic ulcer is:",
      "options": [
        "Fundus of stomach.",
        "Distal end of esophagus.",
        "1st part of duodenum.",
        "Lesser curvature."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The vast majority of peptic ulcers occur in the first part of the duodenum, just beyond the stomach."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Main line of treatment of gastric erosions is:",
      "options": [
        "Conservative treatment.",
        "Surgical ligation of feeding vessel.",
        "Gastrectomy.",
        "None of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Gastric erosions are superficial breaks in the mucosal lining and typically heal well with conservative management, which includes acid-suppressing medications and avoiding irritants like NSAIDs and alcohol."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Helicobacter pylori:",
      "options": [
        "Is a gram -ve bacilli spiral in shape (spirochetes).",
        "Is the most common chronic infection worldwide.",

        "Urease test can easily diagnose infection.",
        "All of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "All the statements are correct. Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped, gram-negative bacterium that is a major cause of peptic ulcers and is the most common chronic infection globally. Its production of the urease enzyme is the basis for a common diagnostic test."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The precancerous possibility of gastric ulcer makes it different from duodenal ones in that:",
      "options": [
        "Regular follow up by endoscopy is indicated.",
        "Surgical treatment if no response to medical treatment within 8 weeks.",
        "Aim of surgery to remove ulcer completely.",
        "All of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Unlike duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers carry a risk of malignancy. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm healing with follow-up endoscopy, consider surgery for non-healing ulcers to rule out cancer, and ensure complete excision of the ulcer during surgery."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Which of the following is/are true regarding vagotomy:",
      "options": [
        "Decrease gastric acidity up to 100%.",

        "Selective vagotomy doesn't need a drainage procedure.",
        "All of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A truncal vagotomy cuts the main vagus nerve trunks, which not only reduces acid secretion but also paralyzes the pyloric pump, leading to gastric stasis. Therefore, a drainage procedure (like a pyloroplasty) is essential to allow the stomach to empty."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Metabolic complications of subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I or Billroth II reconstruction include the following except:",

        "Hereditary spherocytosis.",
        "Sickle cell anemia.",
        "Pernicious anemia.",
        "Mediterranean anemia."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Atrophic gastritis involves the destruction of gastric parietal cells. These cells produce intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. A deficiency in vitamin B12 leads to pernicious anemia."
    },
    {
      "stem": "High-risk patients who will continue bleeding or re-bleed in cases of bleeding peptic ulcer include:",
      "options": [
        "Presentation with shock",

        "Bleeding deep posterior duodenal or lesser curvature gastric ulcers",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "All the factors listed are indicators of severe hemorrhage and a high likelihood of continued or recurrent bleeding, necessitating urgent intervention."
    },
    {
      "stem": "As regards Colloid carcinoma of stomach all are correct except:",
      "options": [
        "Primary colloid carcinoma has better prognosis than secondary.",
        "Secondary colloid carcinoma is due to mucinous degeneration of a tumor.",
        "Can lead to leather bottle stomach.",
        "Is the most common cause of Krukenberg tumor of the ovary."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "All the statements are generally considered correct except for the prognosis. Colloid (mucinous) carcinomas, whether primary or secondary, typically have a poor prognosis. However, within the context of the provided options, the statement that primary has a better prognosis than secondary is considered correct in some classifications, making the other options factually true characteristics of the disease. The answer key indicates 'a' is the intended answer. The most definitive error, however, is that Signet Ring Cell carcinoma, not colloid, is the most common cause of Krukenberg tumors. Given the provided answer key, we select 'a'."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In a patient over the age of 45 presenting with new-onset dyspepsia, it is crucial to rule out serious underlying pathology like gastric cancer. Upper GI endoscopy is the investigation of choice because it allows for direct visualization of the mucosa and the ability to take biopsies."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The following statements about hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are true except that it:",
      "options": [
        "Affects males more often than females.",
        "Manifests itself at birth.",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "While congenital, the symptoms of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically do not appear at birth. They usually manifest between the 2nd and 8th weeks of life."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Among the following statements about benign gastric ulcers, the incorrect one is that they:",
      "options": [
        "Occur most often on the lesser curve of the stomach.",
        "Are always due to hyperacidity.",
        "Produce epigastric pain soon after meals.",
        "Require routine gastroscopy and endoscopic biopsy.",
        "Commonly recur after medical treatment."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Unlike duodenal ulcers, which are strongly associated with hyperacidity, benign gastric ulcers are often found in patients with normal or even low levels of stomach acid (hypoacidity). The primary cause is often a weakened mucosal defense rather than acid overproduction."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The single most critical factor in determining the prognosis for a patient with gastric cancer is the presence and extent of lymph node metastasis. This is a key component of the TNM staging system."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The most frequent site of gastric cancer is the:",
      "options": [
        "Cardia.",
