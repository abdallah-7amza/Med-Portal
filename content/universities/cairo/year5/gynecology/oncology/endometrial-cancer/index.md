# Endometrial Cancer

Endometrial cancer arises from the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. It is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs.

## Risk Factors
The primary risk factor for endometrial cancer is prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen. Key risk factors include:
* Obesity
* Nulliparity (never having given birth)
* Late menopause
* Diabetes Mellitus
* Tamoxifen therapy

## Clinical Presentation
The classic symptom is **postmenopausal bleeding**. Any bleeding after menopause should be investigated to rule out endometrial cancer.
