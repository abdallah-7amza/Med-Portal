                  "summary": "This lesson covers the normal vaginal flora and pH, focusing on Lactobacillus acidophilus, which maintains an acidic environment (pH 3.8-4.5). It explores natural defenses, predisposing factors for infections, and details common types of vaginitis, cervicitis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).",
                  "markdownContent": "\n### **VAGINAL FLORA AND VAGINAL PH**\n\nThe normal vaginal flora in a reproductive-age woman includes multiple aerobic, facultative, and obligate anaerobic species.\n* **Lactobacillus acidophilus is the dominant bacterium in a healthy vagina (MCQ).** It plays a critical role in maintaining the normal vaginal environment by:\n    * Producing **lactic acid**, which is responsible for the **acidic vaginal environment (pH: 3.8-4.5) (MCQ)**.\n    * Producing lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which are toxic to anaerobic bacteria.\n* A decreased glycogen content (as in menopause or childhood) leads to diminished acid production and a rise in vaginal pH, making it alkaline.\n\n#### **NATURAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS AGAINST GENITAL TRACT INFECTION (GTI)**\n\n* **Vaginal PH**: The **slightly acidic vaginal pH** acts as an unfavorable medium for many pathogens **(MCQ)**.\n* **Vaginal epithelium**: The thick stratified squamous epithelium is protective. Normal estrogen levels prevent atrophic changes.\n* **Cellular and Humoral immunity**: These play a role in normal vaginal defense.\n\n#### **FACTORS THAT PREDISPOSE TO VAGINAL INFECTIONS**\n\n1.  **Alterations in the normal vaginal pH**:\n    * Menstrual blood flow (more alkaline).\n    * Vaginal douching.\n    * Decreased estrogen (childhood and menopause).\n    * Sexual intercourse (alkaline semen).\n2.  **Imbalance between vaginal bacterial flora and Candida species**:\n    * As with recent treatment with **broad-spectrum antibiotics (MCQ)**.\n3.  **Decreased resistance of vaginal epithelium**:\n    * Atrophic epithelium (childhood and menopause).\n    * Introduction of new organisms (STDs).\n    * Foreign bodies (tampons, IUD threads).\n4.  **Suppression of immune system**:\n    * HIV infections, autoimmune disorders, corticosteroid therapy, and **diabetes mellitus** can result in recurrent vaginal infections, especially candidiasis **(MCQ)**.\n\n### **COMMON TYPES OF VAGINITIS**\n\nVaginitis is a common complaint occurring at different periods of a woman's life.\n* **In the childbearing period**:\n    * Bacterial vaginosis (BV).\n    * Candida vaginitis (CV).\n    * Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).\n* **In childhood**: Vulvovaginitis of childhood.\n* **In menopausal women**: Senile or Atrophic vaginitis.\n\n#### **Lower Genital Tract Infections in Childbearing period**\n\n**1. BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS**\n\n* **Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest bacterial vaginal infection** and the **commonest cause for non-irritant, malodorous vaginal discharge (MCQ)**.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:\n    * Anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina, including **Gardnerella vaginalis (GV)**, Bacteroides species, and Mycoplasma hominis.\n* BV represents an alteration of normal vaginal flora where:\n    * **Anaerobic organisms markedly increase (MCQ)**.\n    * Hydrogen peroxide-producing **lactobacilli markedly decrease or disappear (MCQ)**.\n    * **The vaginal pH rises, ranging from 4.7-7.0 (alkaline) (MCQ)**.\n    * Anaerobic bacteria produce amines, resulting in a **characteristic fishy odor discharge (MCQ)**.\n* BV is not sexually acquired; the sexual partner does not need to be treated.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:\n    * Asymptomatic in 50% of women.\n    * Vaginal discharge is the commonest symptom: profuse, thin, homogenous, non-irritant, with a **malodorous, fishy amine smell**, especially around menses or after intercourse **(MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS (AMSEL'S CRITERIA)**: Requires at least 3 of the following 4 criteria:\n    1.  Characteristic vaginal discharge.\n    2.  Microscopic examination reveals **characteristic clue cells (MCQ)**.\n    3.  Adding 10% KOH releases a **characteristic fishy odor (whiff test) (MCQ)**.\n    4.  **Vaginal pH > 4.5 (MCQ)**.\n* **TREATMENT OF BV (CDC 2021)**:\n    * **Oral Preparations**: **Metronidazole** tablets: 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.\n    * **Intravaginal Preparations**: **Clindamycin cream** vaginally daily for 7 days.\n    * **During Pregnancy**: **Vaginal Clindamycin may be used from the first trimester**. **Oral Metronidazole may be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.\n* **Ν.Β.**: Women with BV are at increased risk for second-trimester abortion, preterm labor, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\n**2. CANDIDA VAGINITIS**\n\n* Candida vaginitis (Candidiasis or Moniliasis) is the second most common cause of childbearing period vaginitis. It flourishes in acidic media.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:\n    * **Candida albicans** is the causative organism in > 80% of cases. It is a normal inhabitant of the bowel and peri-anal region.\n    * Non-albicans strains are less common and usually resistant to standard antifungal treatment.\n* **PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR SYMPTOMATIC INFECTION**:\n    * Alteration of vaginal pH to more acidic.\n    * **Altered host immunity**: **Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus**, long-term corticosteroid therapy, and **HIV infection (MCQ)**.\n    * **Altered microbiology**: **Long-term use of antibiotics** or chemotherapy **(MCQ)**.\n    * Wetness and moisture.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:\n    * **Vulvar pruritis**: Itching and progressive scratching is usually the main symptom **(MCQ)**.\n    * **Vaginal soreness**: Burning sensation that may cause discomfort and dyspareunia.\n    * **Vaginal discharge**: **scanty, thick, odorless, white discharge (cottage cheese discharge) (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vulvar erythema**: red and swollen, sometimes with **fissures and excoriations (MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:\n    * **Vaginal pH is slightly acidic (< 4.5) (MCQ)**.\n    * Microscopic examination with saline and 10% KOH reveals hyphae or pseudo-hyphae.\n    * Vaginal swabs for culture are not necessary except in resistant or recurrent infection.\n* **TREATMENT OF VAGINAL CANDIDIASIS (CDC 2021)**:\n    * **Non-complicated cases**:\n        * **Oral preparations**: **Fluconazole**; Single oral dose 150 mg **(MCQ)**.\n        * **Intravaginal preparations**: **Clotrimazole cream, OR Tioconazole ointment OR Terconazole vaginal suppository (MCQ)**.\n        * **During pregnancy**: **Only intravaginal treatment for CV is considered safe throughout pregnancy**.\n    * **Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally weekly dose for 6 weeks.\n* **N.B.**: Routine treatment of sexual partners is not recommended, except in symptomatic partners.\n\n**3. TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS VAGINITIS**\n\n* Trichomoniasis is the 3rd most common cause for vaginitis. It is a multifocal infection involving the vaginal epithelium, Skene's glands, Bartholin gland, and urethra.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISM**:\n    * **Trichomonas vaginalis (TV): an ovoid, motile, flagellated protozoon (MCQ)**.\n* **Sexual transmission**: In 70% of cases, TV can be recovered from male partners, hence it is considered a **sexually transmitted disease (STD) (MCQ)**.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms and Signs)**:\n    * **Asymptomatic in 70%-85% of women (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vaginal discharge**: **Copious, yellow or green, frothy, offensive (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vulval irritation** causing burning pain and dyspareunia.\n    * Speculum examination reveals vaginal or cervical punctate hemorrhages in 25% of cases, also known as **strawberry spots (MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:\n    * Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is the most sensitive.\n    * **Saline wet mount preparations** of the vaginal discharge reveal numerous leukocytes and **highly motile flagellated trichomonads (MCQ)**.\n    * Cultures from vaginal discharge.\n    * Pap smear.\n* **TREATMENT (CDC 2021)**:\n    * Recommended regimen: **Metronidazole: 2g single oral dose for both partners (MCQ)**.\n    * **During Pregnancy**: **Oral Metronidazole can be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.\n    * **The male sexual partner should be promptly treated by oral Metronidazole to prevent re-infection (MCQ)**.\n    * Re-testing for the female partner is recommended after 3 months due to high rates of re-infection.\n\n#### **CHILDHOOD VAGINITIS**\n\n* Childhood vulvovaginitis is rare, occurring mostly due to decreased vaginal wall resistance from low estrogen and low vaginal pH.\n* **RISK FACTORS**: Poor hygiene, **foreign body (MCQ)**, Pinworms.\n* **CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**: Bacterial infection (E. coli, streptococci), rare CV and TV.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: Purulent, foul odor, sometimes bloody discharge. Pruritus vulvae.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**: Culture and sensitivity, U.S./X-ray for foreign body.\n* **TREATMENT**: Local cleanliness, systemic antibiotics, and **removal of foreign body in the vagina under anesthesia (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **ATROPHIC VAGINITIS**\n\n* Occurs due to loss of the normal protective thickness of the vaginal epithelium with **decreased estrogen levels (MCQ)**. It is often seen in **postmenopausal women** (senile vaginitis) and breastfeeding women.\n* The vaginal epithelium becomes thin, glycogen content decreases, and **pH becomes alkaline**.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: **Leucorrhea, pruritus, vaginal burning, tenderness, and dyspareunia (MCQ)**. Speculum examination shows atrophic, inflamed walls. **Vaginal pH is alkaline > 4.5**.\n* **TREATMENT**:\n    * Systemic antibiotics if secondarily infected.\n    * **Intravaginal estrogen cream administered every night for 2 weeks, then once weekly (MCQ)**.\n    * Systemic hormone therapy (HT) only if medically indicated for other menopausal symptoms.\n\n### **ACUTE AND CHRONIC CERVICITIS**\n\n**1. ACUTE ENDOCERVICITIS**\n\n* Acute inflammation of endocervical glands, mostly secondary to STPs.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:\n    * **Sexually transmitted pathogens**: **Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia Trachomatis**, and TV **(MCQ)**.\n    * Other bacterial organisms related to IUD insertion, puerperal, post-abortive, or post-operative infection.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: Mucopurulent discharge, backache, dyspareunia. Cervix is red and swollen.\n* **DIAGNOSIS**: Culture and sensitivity in resistant cases.\n* **TREATMENT (CDC 2010)**: Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days OR Azithromycin 1g orally in a single dose (in pregnancy).\n* **COMPLICATIONS**: Chronic Cervicitis, **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) (MCQ)**.\n\n**2.

                  "markdownContent": "\n**Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH)** is bleeding that occurs after fetal viability until delivery (between 24-40 weeks). The bleeding is mostly maternal in origin, but less commonly can be fetal (vasa previa), which rapidly affects fetal wellbeing.\n\n### **CAUSES AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF AΡΗ**\n\n1.  **OBSTETRIC CAUSES:** (detected by ultrasound)\n    * **Placental abruption:** Separation of a normally implanted placenta.\n    * **Placenta Previa:** Separation of an abnormally low implanted placenta.\n    * **Vasa Previa:** Bleeding from the umbilical cord (fetal origin).\n2.  **GYNECOLOGICAL CAUSES:** (detected by speculum examination)\n    * Vaginal trauma or lesions.\n    * Benign (erosion or polyp) or malignant cervical conditions.\n3.  **GENERAL OR SYSTEMIC CAUSES:** (detected from medical history)\n    * Anticoagulant therapy.\n    * Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\n    * Severe, uncontrolled Hypertension (HTN).\n\n### **PLACENTAL ABRUPTION**\n\nPlacental abruption is the separation of a normally implanted placenta. It complicates up to 1% of pregnancies and is the **most common cause for antepartum and intrapartum hemorrhage (MCQ)**. It is a significant cause of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), preterm labor (PTL), and may be associated with **maternal coagulopathy and DIC (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **RISK FACTORS:**\n\n* Abruption in a previous pregnancy.\n* **Maternal hypertension and severe preeclampsia (PE) (MCQ)**.\n* **Sudden ROM in cases with polyhydramnios (MCQ)**.\n* Traumatic abruption from external trauma.\n* **Smoking (MCQ)**.\n* Thrombophilias.\n\n#### **TYPES OF BLEEDING IN PLACENTAL ABRUPTION:**\n\n1.  **Revealed type:** Blood dissects between membranes and is revealed externally through the vagina. **This is the commonest type (MCQ)**.\n2.  **Concealed type:** Blood is trapped, forming a retro-placental haematoma with no external bleeding. **This is the least common and most serious type (MCQ)**. It is often associated with severe PE, **severe pain, a hard tender uterus, and fetal distress (MCQ)**.\n3.  **Mixed type:** Bleeding is partially concealed and partially revealed.\n\n#### **CLINICAL PICTURE:**\n\n* **Mild separation:** Does not affect vital signs.\n* **Severe separation:** Associated with hemorrhagic shock. The degree of shock may not correlate with external bleeding in **concealed or mixed types (MCQ)**.\n* **DIC may occur in cases with concealed hemorrhage (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION:**\n\n* **Uterine tenderness** is usually present.\n* A **rising fundal level may be noticed in concealed hemorrhage (MCQ)** due to an accumulating retroplacental hematoma.\n* **Vaginal examination should only be performed after excluding placenta previa by US (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **DIAGNOSIS:**\n\n* **Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is the gold standard for identifying placental site to exclude placenta previa (MCQ)**. It can also detect a **large retroplacental haematoma in concealed cases (MCQ)**.\n* Laboratory tests: CBC, coagulation profile, liver & kidney function tests.\n* Assessment of fetal wellbeing (FHR tracing, CTG, Doppler US).\n\n#### **PATHOLOGY AND COMPLICATIONS OF SEVERE PALCENTAL ABRUPTION:**\n\n1.  **Hemorrhagic shock, which might be complicated by acute renal tubular necrosis (MCQ)**.\n2.  Sheehan syndrome (acute pituitary necrosis).\n3.  **DIC due to thromboplastin release from damaged tissues (MCQ)**.\n4.  **Couvelaire's uterus:** In concealed hemorrhage, blood dissects into the myometrium, leading to **uterine atony and atonic postpartum hemorrhage (MCQ)**.\n5.  Fetal Complications: **Fetal distress, severe IUGR, IUFD, and preterm delivery (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT:**\n\nManagement can be active (immediate delivery) or expectant (conservative).\n\n* **A) ACTIVE MANAGEMENT (IMMEDIATE DELIVERY):**\n    * **Severe bleeding compromising maternal or fetal lives, regardless of gestational age (MCQ)**.\n    * Gestational age > 36 weeks.\n    * Spontaneous onset of labor.\n* **B) EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT (DELAY DELIVERY):**\n    * Indicated in preterm pregnancies < 36 weeks with **mild bleeding not affecting maternal or fetal well being (MCQ)** and absent labor pains. The goal is to **achieve better lung maturity (MCQ)**.\n* **Route of Delivery:**\n    * **Vaginal delivery is attempted in mild to moderate cases (MCQ)**.\n    * **CS is indicated for severe bleeding or other obstetric indications (MCQ)**.\n* **An Rh-negative mother should receive an Anti-D immunoglobulin injection (MCQ)**.\n\n### **PLACENTA PREVIA**\n\nPlacenta previa (PL PRV) is the implantation of the placenta partially or totally on the lower uterine segment (LUS). It can lead to an **abnormally invasive placenta (AIP) (MCQ)**, especially at the site of a previous CS scar.\n\n#### **INCIDENCE:**\n\n* **Occurs in around 0.5% of all pregnancies (MCQ)**.\n* Incidence is rising due to **increasing maternal age and repeated CS deliveries (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **PREDISPOSING AND RISK FACTORS:**\n\n* **Previous placenta previa (MCQ)**.\n* **Previous cesarean section; risk increases with the number of previous sections (MCQ)**.\n* **Increasing maternal age and parity (MCQ)**.\n* **Increased placental size (e.g., in multifetal pregnancies) (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **MECHANISM OF BLEEDING IN PL PRV:**\n\n* **Bleeding occurs from unavoidable separation of the placenta due to stretching of the LUS (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **PLACENTAL MIGRATION:**\n\n* A low-lying placenta diagnosed before 24 weeks often appears to move upward as the LUS develops. **Almost 90% of these cases resolve by the third trimester (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **CLASSIFICATION AND TYPES OF PL PRV:**\n\n* **Grade I (Lateralis/Low-lying):** Lower edge is > 2cm from the internal os.\n* **Grade II (Marginalis):** Lower edge reaches the internal os. **Considered minor placenta previa (MCQ)**.\n* **Grade III (Incomplete Centralis/Partial):** Placenta partially covers the cervix.\n* **Grade IV (Complete Centralis/Total):** **Placenta completely covers the cervix (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **SYMPTOMS & SIGNS:**\n\n* **Painless, causeless, recurrent vaginal bleeding is the most common presentation (MCQ)**.\n* Severe bleeding can lead to **hypovolemic shock (MCQ)**.\n* Abdominal exam: Uterus is soft and non-tender. **Malpresentations like breech and transverse lie are more frequent (MCQ)** because the placenta interferes with head engagement.\n* **Vaginal Examination (PV): should not be attempted as it may provoke severe uncontrollable bleeding (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **DIAGNOSIS:**\n\n* **A) TRANSABDOMINAL US (TAS): This is the gold standard for diagnosis (MCQ)**.\n* **B) TRANSVAGINAL US (TVS): More reliable than TAS for measuring the distance between the lower placental margin and the internal os (MCQ)**.\n* C) Maternal laboratory tests.\n* D) Tests for fetal wellbeing.\n\n#### **MATERNAL AND FETAL RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS IN PL PRV:**\n\n1.  **Severe APH leading to hypovolemic shock (MCQ)**.\n2.  **Severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)** due to poor contractility of the LUS.\n3.  Increased risk of CS hysterectomy.\n4.  **Increased risk of abnormally invasive placenta (placenta accreta), especially with a previous CS scar (MCQ)**.\n5.  Fetal complications due to prematurity, IUGR, and massive blood loss.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT OF PL PRV:**\n\n* **All cases of total, partial, and marginal PL PRV will be delivered by CS (MCQ)**.\n* **A) ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BY IMMEDIATE CS:**\n    * **Severe bleeding compromising maternal or fetal lives, regardless of gestational age (MCQ)**.\n    * Gestational age > 36 weeks.\n    * Spontaneous onset of labor.\n* **B) EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT TO DELAY DELIVERY:**\n    * In **preterm pregnancies < 36 weeks with mild bleeding (MCQ)** and no labor pains, to allow for lung maturity. This requires hospitalization and close monitoring.\n* **C) LATERAL PL PRV:**\n    * A trial of vaginal delivery can be offered if the lower edge is 2 cm or more from the internal os and bleeding is minimal.\n\n### **PLACENTA ACCRETA SPECTRUM (Abnormally Invasive Placenta)**\n\nThis is a serious condition where the placenta adheres to or invades the myometrium, occurring mostly with PL PRV due to **poor decidual reaction in the LUS, especially at a previous CS scar site (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **TYPES OF ADHERENT PLACENTA:**\n\n* **Accreta:** Placenta is adherent to the myometrium (most common, 80%).\n* **Increta:** Placenta invades the myometrium.\n* **Percreta:** Placenta perforates the myometrium, potentially invading the bladder wall.\n\n#### **DIAGNOSIS DURING PREGNANCY:**\n\n* Can be achieved by expert **US (2D/3D and color Doppler) (MCQ)**.\n* **US reveals absence of a plane of cleavage between placenta and myometrium, with blood lacunae in cases of invasion (MCQ)**.\n* MRI can also be used but offers **no significant benefit over expert US (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **DIAGNOSIS DURING LABOR:**\n\n* Discovered when the placenta is partially or totally retained, leading to **severe atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (MCQ)**.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT:**\n\n* **The majority of cases will require CS hysterectomy as a life-saving procedure (MCQ)**.\n\n### **RUPTURE VASA PREVIA (FETAL BLEEDING)**\n\nA very rare condition where umbilical cord vessels cross the internal os, often associated with **velamentous insertion of the cord or a succenturiate lobe (MCQ)**. Rupture of these vessels during labor leads to **fetal bleeding, severe fetal distress, and potential intrapartum fetal death (MCQ)**. The condition requires an **emergency CS (MCQ)**.\n",

Viability denotes the chance of survival with maximum pediatric support.\n\n**INCIDENCE:**\nOccurs in **15-20%** of pregnancies, mostly in the early 1st trimester.\n\n**ETIOLOGY:**\n* **Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities in > 50% of cases (MCQ).**\n* Accidental trauma.\n* Hormonal as luteal phase defect.\n* Infections e.g. acute maternal fever.\n* Drugs: some teratogenic drugs may cause fetal demise.\n* Psychological factors or idiopathic.\n\n**CLINICAL TYPES OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION:**\n* Threatened abortion.\n* Inevitable abortion.\n* Incomplete abortion.\n* Complete abortion.\n* Missed abortion.\n* Septic abortion.\n\n---\n### THREATENED ABORTION\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* Minimal vaginal bleeding.\n* Mild suprapubic colicky pain may be present.\n* **Cervix is closed (MCQ).**\n* **Ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac with a living fetus (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* Serial quantitative ẞHCG estimation to detect adequate doubling.\n* **Ultrasonography is the main diagnostic tool** to confirm fetal condition.\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Physical & mental rest.\n* **Hormonal support e.g. natural progesterone is beneficial in cases with luteal phase defect (MCQ).**\n* Follow up to ensure clinical improvement and fetal growth.\n\n**Prognosis:**\n**50% of cases will continue pregnancy** and 50% will end in inevitable or missed abortion.\n\n---\n### INEVITABLE ABORTION\nThere is no chance for pregnancy to continue.\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* **Moderate to severe vaginal bleeding** which may cause hypovolemic shock.\n* **Rupture of membranes <24 weeks is a sign of inevitability.**\n* Marked suprapubic colicky pain.\n* **PV examination reveals a dilated cervix (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* Ultrasonography to detect gestational age and decide the route of termination.\n* Blood group and CBC.\n\n**Treatment:**\nAnti-shock measures and termination of pregnancy:\n* **Anti-shock measures:** Rest, sedation, I.V crystalloids infusion, and blood transfusion if needed.\n* **Termination of pregnancy:**\n    * **<12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation by curettage or suction (MCQ).**\n    * **>12 weeks:** Medical evacuation by prostaglandins. If bleeding is severe, **abdominal hysterotomy is performed (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### INCOMPLETE ABORTION\nPart of the conception products are expelled from the uterus.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* Bleeding & pain similar to inevitable abortion, with **passage of parts of conception products (MCQ).**\n* **PV examination reveals an opened cervix with retained parts (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* **Ultrasonography detects retained products of conception (POC) (MCQ).**\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Anti-shock measures.\n* **Surgical evacuation.**\n\n---\n### COMPLETE ABORTION\nAll conception products are expelled from the uterus. **Bleeding and pain cease, and ultrasound confirms an empty uterus (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### MISSED ABORTION\nDeath of an embryo or fetus that is retained in the uterus.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* May be symptomless initially, later a **brownish vaginal discharge (MCQ)** and recurrent bleeding may occur, with loss of pregnancy symptoms.\n* PV examination reveals a smaller-than-expected uterus with a **closed internal os**.\n* **Coagulation problems like hypofibrinogenaemia and DIC may develop if retained for several weeks (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* **US examination is diagnostic**, revealing intrauterine fetal demise or anembryonic sac (blighted ovum).\n* Inadequate doubling or decreasing hCG levels.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTermination of pregnancy:\n* <12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation.\n* **>12 weeks: Medical induction by prostaglandins (MCQ).** Oxytocin is not effective due to decreased receptors. Abdominal hysterotomy is rare.\n* **N.B:** Following abortion, **Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to RH-ve mothers.**\n\n---\n### SEPTIC ABORTION\nInfection superimposed on any type of abortion, usually incomplete.\n\n**Routes of infection:**\n* Exogenous: from instruments.\n* Endogenous: from genital tract flora.\n* Autogenous: from a septic focus in the body.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Clinical picture of abortion.\n* Clinical picture of infection:\n    * **Generally:** Fever, headache, malaise, or septic shock.\n    * **Locally:** Lower abdominal pain, tender uterus, and **offensive vaginal discharge.**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* U.S. to detect intrauterine contents.\n* Blood picture shows leukocytosis.\n* Blood culture, kidney/liver functions, and coagulation profile.\n* Vaginal/cervical swab culture has limited value.\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Isolate the patient, Fowler's position.\n* Antishock measures may be needed.\n* **Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics.**\n* **Obstetrical management:**\n    * < 12 weeks: Vaginal surgical evacuation under antibiotic cover.\n    * >12 weeks: Medical induction. Hysterotomy or hysterectomy may be done if failed or uterus is markedly infected.\n\n**Complications:**\n* **Septic shock.**\n* **Acute renal & liver failure.**\n* **DIC.**\n\n---\n### SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TYPES OF ABORTION\n| | **Threatened Ab.** | **Missed** | **Inevitable** | **Incomplete** | **complete** | **septic** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Symptoms** | | | | | | |\n| 1-Bleeding | -ve | -ve | +ve | +ve | -ve | +ve |\n| 2-cramping Pelvic pain | Usually mild + | Usually mild + | ++or+++ | ++or+++ | + or -ve | Foul vag. discharge Fever |\n| **General exam.** | | | | | | |\n| Bp | Normotensive | Normotensive | Hypotension May be shocked | Hypotension May be shocked | Normotensive | Normotensive |\n| Pulse (rate and volume) | Average | Average | Rapid & low volume | Rapid & low volume | Average | Fever Rapid+good volume |\n| **Pelvic exam.** | | | | | | |\n| 1-Bleeding | Mild + | Mild + | Moderate/severe | Moderate/severe | Mild + | -ve or +ve |\n| 2-Int.

The suture is removed at 37 weeks or at the onset of labor.\n\n---\n### ECTOPIC PREGNANCY\n**Definition:** Implantation of the fertilized ovum outside the normal uterine cavity.\n\n**Incidence:** 0.5-2% of all pregnancies.\n\n**Sites:**\n* **Fallopian tube is the most common site (MCQ)**, mostly in the ampulla.\n* Other sites: Ovary, abdomen, rudimentary horn, cervix, CS scar.\n\n### TUBAL ECTOPIC\n**Etiology and Risk factors:**\n* **Previous ectopic gestation (MCQ).**\n* Previous Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).\n* Endometriosis.\n* Pelvic and tubal surgery.\n* **IUD: prevents intrauterine pregnancy but not extra-uterine (MCQ).**\n* **Progesterone effect (e.g., in progesterone-only contraception) (MCQ).**\n* **ICSI procedure.**\n* **N.B.: Previous cesarean section is not a primary risk factor for tubal ectopic pregnancy (MCQ).**\n\n**Pathology:**\n* **Uterus:** Slightly enlarged with decidua present without chorionic villi (Arias-Stella reaction).\n* **Tube:** Disturbance of pregnancy occurs as early as 8-10 weeks.\n* **Results:** Tubal mole, tubal abortion, or tubal rupture.\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n* **[I] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, subacute type (stable):**\n    * **Symptoms:**\n        * Short period of amenorrhea.\n        * **Pain is the most prominent symptom (MCQ). It may be aching, stabbing, or colicky. It precedes vaginal bleeding (MCQ).**\n        * **Shoulder pain occurs in massive internal hemorrhage (MCQ).**\n        * **Vaginal bleeding is usually slight and dark (MCQ).**\n        * Syncope, nausea, and vomiting.\n    * **Signs:**\n        * **General:** Rapid pulse, falling BP proportional to internal bleeding.\n        * **Abdominal:** Lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness.\n        * **Vaginal:** Marked tenderness on moving the cervix. Uterus slightly enlarged, adnexal mass may be felt.\n* **[II] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, acute type (unstable):**\n    * The patient is shocked with severe intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. **It is an emergency.**\n* **[III] Undisturbed tubal pregnancy:**\n    * No symptoms or mild pelvic pain. Discovered accidentally.\n\n**Specific investigations:**\n* **The most important are combined transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and estimation of ß-hCG (MCQ).**\n* **TVS:** **Diagnostic findings are an empty uterus with an adnexal mass** and pelvic fluid collection.\n* **Serum ßhCG level:** In ectopic pregnancy, there is an **improper doubling of the level after 48 hours (MCQ).**\n* **Discrimination zone:** With a ß-HCG level of **>1500 IU/mL, a gestational sac should be seen intrauterine by TVS (MCQ).** If the uterus is empty, it confirms an ectopic pregnancy.\n* **Laparoscopy:** Used to confirm the diagnosis in doubtful, hemodynamically stable cases.\n\n**Management of tubal pregnancy:**\n* Blood transfusion and antishock measures may be needed.\n* **Anti-D should be given to RH-ve cases.**\n* **(A) Surgical treatment:**\n    * **Conservative:** Salpingostomy (linear incision to remove ectopic), tube heals by secondary intention. Recurrence rate is high.\n    * **Radical:** Unilateral salpingectomy.\n* **(B) Medical treatment by methotrexate injections:**\n    * **Mode of action:** Antifolinic acid.\n    * **Indications:** Undisturbed early cases with ectopic < 3cm, **no fetal heart activity (MCQ)**, and hCG <6000 mIU/ml.\n    * Contraindications: **History of active hepatic or renal disease (MCQ).**\n    * Regimen: Single IM injection. Follow up with serum ß-HCG.\n    * Counseling: **Subsequent pregnancy should be delayed for 3 months (MCQ).**\n\n### Other Types of Ectopic Pregnancy\n* **Ovarian Ectopic Pregnancy:** Similar symptoms to tubal. Treatment aims to preserve ovarian tissue.\n* **Advanced Abdominal Pregnancy:** Rare. Placenta is often left in situ to avoid massive hemorrhage.\n* **Pregnancy in a Rudimentary Horn:** **Ruptures late, around 4th-5th month (MCQ).**\n* **Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy:** **Presents with severe vaginal bleeding rather than pain (MCQ).** Hysterectomy may be needed for life-threatening bleeding.\n* **CS Scar Pregnancy:** Increasing frequency. Can be treated with methotrexate or surgery. **Curettage is not a good option (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE (GTD)\nA spectrum of cellular proliferations from placental trophoblasts.\n* **Benign GTD:** Vesicular (Hydatidiform) Mole (Complete and Partial).\n* **Malignant GTD:** Invasive Mole and **Choriocarcinoma (MCQ).**\n\n### VESICULAR (HYDATIDIFORM) MOLE\nRare, benign form of GTD.\n\n**Risk factors:** **Extremes of age (<20 & >35 years).**\n\n**Pathology:**\n* **A. Complete mole:**\n    * Originates from **fertilization of an empty ovum, resulting in a 46 XX karyotype (MCQ).**\n    * **Gross:** Uterine cavity distended with grape-like vesicles. **No amniotic sac or fetal tissue.**\n    * **Histology:** Diffuse trophoblastic proliferation, marked villous edema, absent fetal blood vessels.\n* **B. Partial mole:**\n    * Originates from fertilization of a normal ovum by 2 sperms, leading to **triploidy (69 chromosomes).**\n    * **Gross:** Focal hydatidiform changes, with presence of amniotic sac or fetal tissues.\n    * **Histology:** Focal villous edema and trophoblastic proliferation.\n* **C. Associated ovarian cysts:**\n    * **Functional ovarian theca lutein cysts occur in 25-60% of complete moles** due to high hCG levels.\n    * **They undergo spontaneous regression after molar evacuation (MCQ).**\n\n**Clinical picture of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Recurrent early pregnancy bleeding is the chief symptom.**\n* **Severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) due to high hCG levels.**\n* Characteristic prune juice discharge or expulsion of vesicles.\n* **Fundal level larger than gestational age.**\n* Uterus is soft and **doughy.**\n* Fetal parts and heart pulsations are absent in complete moles.\n\n**Diagnostic investigations:**\n* **Ultrasonography is the gold standard.**\n    * **Complete mole: shows a characteristic \"snowstorm\" appearance (MCQ).**\n    * Partial Mole: shows an embryo, often with anomalies, and vesicular changes in the placenta.\n* **Serum ß-hCG: Abnormally high levels, often >100,000 mIU/ml (MCQ).**\n* Metastatic workup for malignant changes.\n\n**Complications of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Hyperemesis gravidarum.**\n* Severe bleeding.\n* **Early onset pregnancy induced hypertension.**\n* **Hyperthyroidism.**\n* Trophoblastic embolization.\n* Risk of developing Invasive Mole or **Choriocarcinoma (5% of complete moles) (MCQ).**\n* **Subsequent uterine adenocarcinoma is not a complication (MCQ).**\n\n**Management of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Suction evacuation is the gold standard technique (MCQ).**\n* Gentle curettage is performed after suction to ensure complete evacuation.\n* **Hysterectomy is indicated only in elderly patients (>40 years) with a completed family (MCQ).**\n* **Follow up:**\n    * **Repeated serum ß-hCG assays weekly until negative for 3 weeks, then monthly for 1 year (MCQ).**\n    * **Contraception is recommended for 1 year.**\n* **Persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD):** Incomplete fall of hCG levels after evacuation. Treated with methotrexate.\n\n### Malignant Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)\nIncludes Invasive Mole and Choriocarcinoma.\n* **More than 50% follow a molar pregnancy.**\n* Characterized by aggressive invasion and tendency to metastasize (lung, vagina, brain, liver).\n* **Gestational Choriocarcinoma:** A highly malignant tumor with early blood-borne metastases.\n\n**Diagnosis of Malignant GTD:**\n* **Persistent vaginal bleeding** following a pregnancy event.\n* **Abnormally high or rising hCG levels** after a terminated pregnancy.\n* Imaging (TVS/TAS, MRI, CT) to detect uterine lesion and metastases.\n\n**Management:**\n* **Chemotherapy is the main line of treatment.**\n* Hysterectomy may be offered to elderly patients or in cases with severe bleeding.\n",
