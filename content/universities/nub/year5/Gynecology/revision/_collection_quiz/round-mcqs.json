      "stem": "A patient with a 46,XX karyotype, normal ovaries, but an absent uterus and vagina may have which condition?",
      "options": [
        "Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome",
        "Asherman syndrome"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Females with Mullerian agenesis (MRKH Syndrome) have a 46,XX karyotype and congenital failure of development of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. They have normal ovaries that are capable of producing normal amounts of estrogen."

      "options": [
        "Breast development",
        "Uterine growth",
        "Axillary & pubic hair growth",
        "Endometrial proliferation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Estrogen contributes to breast development, uterine growth, and endometrial proliferation. However, axillary and pubic hair growth occurs under the effect of ACTH and androgens, not estrogen."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Which hormones characteristically increase after Menopause?",
      "options": [
        "Estrogen and Progesterone",
        "FSH and LH",
        "Prolactin"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "After menopause, there is a marked increase in serum FSH & LH levels due to the depletion of ovarian primordial follicles and subsequent cessation of ovarian estrogen (E2) secretion, releasing the pituitary gland from negative feedback."

        "Estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor",
        "McCune-Albright syndrome"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Precocious puberty describes the appearance of secondary sexual characters before 8 years of age. If there is vaginal bleeding and breast enlargement (signs of estrogen effect) but no axillary or pubic hair (which would be influenced by androgens), it suggests a source of estrogen that is not also producing androgens, such as an estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Imperforate hymen can cause primary amenorrhea and cyclic, monthly abdominal pain due to accumulation of menstrual blood (hematocolpos and hematometra). Short stature is a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, not imperforate hymen."
    },
    {
      "stem": "In cervical atresia, all of the following are present EXCEPT:",
      "options": [
        "Hematometra",
        "Hematocolpos",
        "Hematosalpinx"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In congenital cervical atresia, failure of canalization of the cervical canal leads to accumulation of menstrual blood, resulting in marked hematometra (blood in uterus) but no hematocolpos (blood in vagina) because the cervix is blocked. The source does not list hematosalpinx as a feature present in cervical atresia."

    {
      "stem": "Ovulation occurs approximately how long after the onset of the LH surge?",
      "options": [
        "12 hours",
        "24 hours",
        "36 hours"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Ovulation (oocyte release) occurs approximately 36 hours after the onset of the LH surge and about 12 hours after the LH peak."

        "Mild oligospermia",
        "Failure of IUI",
        "Severe tubal adhesions"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Mild oligospermia is listed as an indication for Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI). IVF/ICSI is indicated for severe male factor, failed IUI, severe tubal adhesions, and unexplained infertility."
    },
    {
      "stem": "IVF is used in all of the following EXCEPT:",
      "options": [
        "Tubal blockage",
        "Azoospermia",
        "Unexplained infertility"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "IVF, particularly with ICSI, is indicated for tubal blockage, severe male factor, and unexplained infertility. While severe male factor is an indication, the question implies azoospermia as an exception, potentially because it may require additional procedures for sperm retrieval or donor sperm, which fall outside the typical direct 'use' of IVF without preliminary steps."

        "Cardinal (transverse cervical) ligament",
        "Pelvic floor muscles"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The cervical ligaments, which include the Mackenrodt’s ligaments (lateral cervical or cardinal ligaments of the cervix), are described as the strongest cervical ligaments and act as the chief support of the uterus and pelvic structures."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are both listed as causes of anovulation. Asherman syndrome is characterized by acquired intrauterine adhesions that prevent endometrial proliferation, leading to secondary amenorrhea, but it is not a primary cause of anovulation; rather, it's a uterine factor."

        "Perform a myomectomy"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Uterine leiomyomas are listed as a contraindication for IUD use if they interfere with proper insertion or cause complications. However, the presence of a fibroid at the fundus, especially if not described as large or interfering with insertion, does not automatically contraindicate IUD replacement, implying that it can be replaced as long as proper placement is ensured. The option 'replace the IUD' implies that it's feasible given the specific information."
