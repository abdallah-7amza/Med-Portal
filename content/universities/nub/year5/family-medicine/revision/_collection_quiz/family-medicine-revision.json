        "Basic labs as urine analysis.",
        "CT scan of the chest."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Primary care facilities like family health units provide basic outpatient, preventive, and curative services, which may include simple lab tests and X-rays. Advanced imaging like a CT scan is a service provided at secondary or tertiary care levels (hospitals)."
    },
    {
      "stem": "You are reading an article about the common presentations at the family medicine outpatient clinic and found that one of the commonest presentation is:",

        "Specific problem-solving skills",
        "Person centered care"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The comprehensive approach in family medicine involves addressing acute issues, chronic conditions, and health promotion simultaneously. By discussing weight management and a new diabetes diagnosis during a visit for a sore throat, the physician is providing comprehensive care for the patient's overall health."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Why are you going to refer him for tertiary care?",
      "options": [
        "To Endocrinologist to manage his high blood sugar.",

        "Keep doing this for the sake of the patient.",
        "Referral is sharing and not transferring responsibility.",
        "Referral is ok so long you didn’t exceed 30% of your patients.",
        "Refer only on patient’s demands."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A core principle of the referral process is that the primary care physician remains central to coordinating the patient's total care. A referral is a collaboration to share responsibility for a specific problem, not to transfer all responsibility to the specialist."
    },
    {
      "stem": "You are assessing the physical growth of a 2-months-old boy. The main parameter of assessment is:",

      "explanation": "The main parameters used to assess physical growth in infants are anthropometric measurements: weight, length/height, and head circumference."
    },
    {
      "stem": "A 6-month-old girl is brought to the family medicine clinic by her mother for common cold. The mother is asking you about the developmental milestones that should be attained by the child at this age. You told her that she can:",

    },
    {
      "stem": "A mother of a 12-month-old boy is asking you about the ideal weight for her child. His birthweight was 3 kg. His growth chart shows his weight consistently tracking along the 15th percentile line. What are you going to tell her?",

        "Calculate her BMI and if",
        "Calculate her BMI and plot it on appropriate curves."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "When a child's weight percentile is significantly higher than their height percentile, using weight-for-age charts alone is insufficient. The standard method to assess for obesity is to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and plot it on a BMI-for-age percentile chart, which accounts for both height and weight."
    },
    {
      "stem": "A 16-year-old boy's height growth chart shows his growth is consistently parallel to, but below, the 5th percentile. What is the most common cause of this condition?",

        "Give her any commercial multivitamin."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The AAP recommends that all breastfed infants receive 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation daily, beginning in the first few days of life, to prevent rickets. Iron supplementation for full-term breastfed infants is recommended to begin at 4 months of age."
