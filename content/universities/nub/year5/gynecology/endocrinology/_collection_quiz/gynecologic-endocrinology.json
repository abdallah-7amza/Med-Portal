    {
      "stem": "The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with:",
      "options": [
        "High progesterone level.",
        "High LH levels.",
        "Low basal body temperature.",
        "Low prolactin level.",
        "Rising FSH levels."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The luteal phase follows ovulation and is characterized by the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes high levels of progesterone. Progesterone is responsible for the secretory changes in the endometrium and a rise in basal body temperature during this phase."
    },
    {
      "stem": "After ovulation all of the following happens EXCEPT:",
      "options": [
        "Thick cervical mucous.",
        "Progesterone secretion.",
        "Proliferative endometrium.",
        "Corpus luteum.",
        "Higher basal body temperature."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "After ovulation, the corpus luteum forms and secretes progesterone. Progesterone causes the cervical mucus to become thick and viscid and induces a higher basal body temperature. The endometrium enters the secretory phase under progesterone's influence, while the proliferative phase occurs before ovulation under estrogen's effect."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Menarche usually occurs at the age of:",
      "options": [
        "8-10 years.",
        "11-13 years.",
        "14-16 years.",
        "17-18 years.",
        "18 and above."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Menarche, which is the onset of menstruation, normally occurs between 11-13 years of age. This follows the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics, triggered by rising estrogen levels due to pituitary FSH secretion."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Under the effect of progesterone, cervical mucus shows:",
      "options": [
        "Profuse amount.",
        "Decreased viscosity.",
        "Decreased leucocytes.",
        "Maximum Ferning test.",
        "Positive Thread test."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The provided correct answer is (c) Decreased leucocytes. However, according to the source, under the effect of progesterone (luteal phase), cervical mucus is characterized by increased leucocytes, becoming scanty and thick-viscid, with a negative Ferning test and negative Spinbarkeit test."
    },
    {
      "stem": "A 19 years old, unmarried female, presented to ER with sudden onset of right lower abdominal pain 1 week after the end of her menses. This pain is associated with a mild increase in vaginal secretions and blood spotting. Ultrasound revealed a normal sized AVF uterus and right adnexal clear cystic structure 20 mm in diameter. What is your provisional diagnosis for this case?",
      "options": [
        "Mild PID.",
        "Ovulatory pain.",
        "Endometriosis.",
        "Ectopic pregnancy.",
        "Ovarian torsion."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation with sudden onset right lower abdominal pain approximately 1 week after the end of her menses, along with a small adnexal cystic structure (20 mm), is highly suggestive of ovulatory pain (Mittelschmerz). This pain occurs around the time of ovulation, when the follicle matures or ruptures. The mild spotting and increased vaginal secretions can also be associated with ovulation."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Selection of the dominant follicle in the menstrual cycle is mainly due to:",
      "options": [
        "High level of FSH at start of the follicular phase.",
        "Low level of LH at early follicular phase.",
        "Increased FSH receptors in the selected follicle.",
        "Least aromatase activity in the selected follicle.",
        "Decreasing inhibin level."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The selection of the dominant follicle is primarily due to its increased sensitivity to FSH, which results from a rapid proliferation of FSH receptors within that follicle. Estrogen (E2) produced by the follicle further enhances the induction of FSH receptors on granulosa cells."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Regarding luteal phase defect, choose the correct answer:",
      "options": [
        "Serum progesterone is less than 5ng/ml in day 21.",
        "Basal body temperature is monophasic.",
        "Premenstrual endometrial biopsy shows proliferative endometrium.",
        "Common cause of recurrent 2nd trimester abortion.",
        "Common to occur with clomiphene citrate use for ovulation induction."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Luteal phase defect (LPD) is a condition where the endometrium shows poor secretory changes. It is a common complication that can occur with the prolonged use of clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction. This is due to CC's effect on decreasing endogenous FSH release."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Normal luteal phase vaginal cytology shows:",
      "options": [
        "Superficial cells with non-rolled edges.",
        "Eosinophilic cytoplasm.",
        "Pyknotic nucleus.",
        "Few lymphocytes.",
        "Maturation index 0-70-30."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "In the luteal phase, under the effect of progesterone, there is shedding of more intermediate cells from the vaginal epithelium. The maturation index, which calculates the ratio of basal, intermediate, and superficial cells, would reflect this shift. A maturation index of 0-70-30 (basal-intermediate-superficial) indicates a predominance of intermediate cells, consistent with the luteal phase."

      "stem": "The following is not controlled by hypothalamic releasing hormones?",
      "options": [
        "Prolactin.",
        "FSH and LH.",
        "TSH.",
        "ACTH.",
        "Growth hormone."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "All pituitary hormones, including FSH, LH, TSH, ACTH, and growth hormone (GH), are stimulated and controlled by hypothalamic releasing hormones. However, prolactin (PRL) is an exception, as it is primarily under chronic inhibition by prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF) from the hypothalamus, rather than being stimulated by a releasing hormone."

      "stem": "The functions of mid-cycle LH surge include the following EXСЕРТ:",
      "options": [
        "Enhances thecal cell androgen production.",
        "Induces final maturation of the dominant follicle.",
        "Initiates resumption of meiosis.",
        "Facilitates oocyte expulsion.",
        "Produces luteolysis."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "The mid-cycle LH surge is crucial for final maturation of the dominant follicle, initiating resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, and facilitating oocyte expulsion (ovulation). LH also enhances thecal cell androgen production. Luteolysis, the degeneration of the corpus luteum, occurs at the end of the luteal phase, approximately 9 days after ovulation, due to the decline in E2, P, and inhibin, not directly produced by the mid-cycle LH surge."

    {
      "stem": "When do the oogonia begin meiosis in the female?",
      "options": [
        "At puberty.",
        "Monthly during menstruation.",
        "At age 20.",
        "Toward the end of gestation of the female fetus.",
        "During the luteal phase of the cycle."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The provided answer key states (a) At puberty. However, the provided textbook excerpts do not explicitly state the exact time when oogonia begin meiosis. The textbook mentions that each primordial follicle consists of a single oocyte arrested in the diplotene stage and that resumption of meiosis occurs during ovulation, implying that meiosis has already started and been arrested much earlier."

    {
      "stem": "Which of the following is suggestive of ovulation?",
      "options": [
        "Basal body temperature drops at least 0.5C in the second half of the cycle.",
        "Day 21 estrogen level is elevated.",
        "Progesterone level on day 10 of the cycle is elevated.",
        "Regular cycle with dysmenorrhea.",
        "Oligomenorrhoea."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Primary dysmenorrhea is almost always associated with ovulatory cycles. Regular menstrual cycles typically indicate that ovulation is occurring consistently. Other options are incorrect: basal body temperature rises in the luteal phase; progesterone levels are elevated in the mid-luteal phase (around day 21), not day 10; and oligomenorrhea is often linked to anovulation."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with:",
      "options": [
        "High luteinizing hormone level.",
        "High progesterone levels.",
        "High prolactin level.",
        "Low basal body temperature.",
        "Proliferative changes in the endometrium."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which follows ovulation, is characterized by the formation of the corpus luteum and its secretion of high levels of progesterone. Progesterone is responsible for the secretory changes in the endometrium and a rise in basal body temperature during this phase. LH levels are high before ovulation (LH surge)."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The follicular phase of menstrual cycle is characterized by:",
      "options": [
        "Endometrial gland proliferation.",
        "Decreased ovarian estradiol production.",
        "Progesterone dominance.",
        "A fixed length of 8 days.",
        "A reduction in aromatase activity."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The follicular phase of the ovarian cycle coincides with the proliferative phase of the endometrium. During this time, ovarian estrogen, produced by maturing follicles, stimulates endometrial gland and stromal growth (proliferation)."

    {
      "stem": "An involuted corpus luteum becomes a hyalinized mass known as:",
      "options": [
        "Corpus delicti.",
        "Corpus granulosa.",
        "Graafian follicle.",
        "Corpus atretic.",
        "Corpus albicans."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "After approximately 9 days, if pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum undergoes luteolysis and is replaced by an avascular hyalinized mass known as the corpus albicans."

        "Has inadequate luteal progesterone production.",
        "Has inadequate follicular estrogen production.",
        "Can be corrected by estrogen.",
        "Associated with delayed menstruation.",
        "Can lead to hypo-prolactinemia."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Luteal phase defect (LPD) is defined as a condition characterized by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase (5-10 ng/ml at day 21) and/or a short luteal phase duration (<11 days). This results in poor secretory changes in the endometrium."

    {
      "stem": "On examination of endometrial tissue, simple columnar epithelium with no sub nuclear vacuoles is detected. The stroma is edematous, & a tortuous gland contains secretions. These findings are consistent with:",
      "options": [
        "Early proliferative phase.",
        "Mid-proliferative phase.",
        "Late proliferative.",
        "Mid-secretory.",
        "Non-ovulatory cycle."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The endometrial findings of edematous stroma, glandular tortuosity, and secretions are highly consistent with the mid-secretory phase of the endometrial cycle. This phase occurs after ovulation and is under the influence of progesterone, which induces maximal secretory changes. The proliferative phase, in contrast, is characterized by glandular and stromal growth rather than widespread secretions."

        "After follicles ripened in the ovary.",
        "36 hours after LH surge."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Ovulation (oocyte release) occurs approximately 36 hours after the onset of the LH surge, and about 12 hours after the LH peak."

        "Genital development.",
        "Breast tissue development.",
        "Start of menstruation."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In precocious puberty, early estrogen production leads to premature epiphyseal bone closure, resulting in permanent short stature. This effect on bone age and growth is considered not correctable in the long term, unlike the development of secondary sexual characteristics or menstruation, which can be managed with therapy."

        "Premature thelarche.",
        "Granulosa cell tumors.",
        "Central precocious puberty."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation with breast and pubic hair development before the age of 8 years, combined with follicular levels of FSH and LH, indicates an activated hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This is characteristic of central precocious puberty (true isosexual precocious puberty), which is due to premature activation of the GnRH pathway leading to early FSH and E2 secretion."

        "Clomiphene citrate.",
        "No treatment; just reassurance."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "For central precocious puberty, the most suitable treatment involves long-acting GnRH agonists. These agonists initially stimulate, then suppress pituitary FSH and LH, which in turn reduces ovarian estrogen production, thereby halting the progression of puberty and preventing premature epiphyseal closure and resultant short stature."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The most common cause of true isosexual precocious puberty (GnRH-dependent) is constitutional (idiopathic), accounting for approximately 74% of cases. This form is due to idiopathic premature activation of the GnRH pathway."

        "None of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The typical sequence of pubertal growth in females, according to the textbook, starts with the growth spurt, followed by breast development (thelarche), then pubic hair growth (pubarche, linked to adrenarche), the onset of menstruation (menarche), and finally axillary hair development (axillarche)."

        "Imperforate hymen.",
        "Clitoridal cyst."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea at 13 years old (age of puberty), along with a history of cyclical lower abdominal pain and a tense bulge in the region of the hymen on examination, is highly characteristic of an imperforate hymen. This condition leads to the accumulation of menstrual blood (hematocolpos) behind the hymen, causing cyclical pain and the visible bulge."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation with primary amenorrhea at 16 years old, well-developed secondary sexual characteristics (breast, pubic, and axillary hair), and a pelvi-abdominal swelling is most consistent with an outflow tract obstruction. This condition allows for normal hormone production and secondary sexual development but prevents the egress of menstrual blood, leading to its accumulation and forming a pelvic mass (hematocolpos/hematometra)."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of secondary amenorrhea following dilatation and curettage (D&C) for a missed abortion is the classic clinical picture for Asherman's syndrome. Asherman's syndrome involves acquired intrauterine adhesions that prevent endometrial proliferation. The gold standard diagnostic tool for this condition, allowing direct visualization and potential treatment, is hysteroscopy."

        "Hyperprolactinemia.",
        "Thyroid dysfunction."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of amenorrhea following severe postpartum hemorrhage is the classic definition of Sheehan's syndrome. This condition involves anterior pituitary necrosis, leading to diminished FSH and LH secretion, and subsequent ovarian failure to produce estrogen and progesterone. A positive withdrawal bleeding with exogenous estrogen/progestogen confirms that the endometrium is responsive, further supporting a pituitary-level problem rather than a uterine issue."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Heterosexual precocious puberty is characterized by the development of secondary sexual characteristics that do not match the genetic and phenotypic sex, or isosexual precocity accompanied by virilization, and it is GnRH-independent. Causes include congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), exogenous androgen intake, adrenal tumors, and androgen-secreting ovarian tumors. Constitutional precocious puberty, however, is a form of isosexual precocious puberty, where secondary sexual characteristics are in agreement with the genetic sex (e.g., early breast development and menarche in a girl). Therefore, constitutional precocious puberty is not a cause of heterosexual precocious puberty."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "The patient's ability to still express milk daily from both breasts several months after cessation of breastfeeding, in the absence of any medication use or other abnormal physical findings, is most consistent with physiologic galactorrhea. While hyperprolactinemia is often the underlying cause of galactorrhea, it can persist for some time after the cessation of lactation due to lingering physiological effects."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The management of galactorrhea secondary to hyperprolactinemia, even if physiological, often involves dopamine agonists. Cabergoline is a commonly used dopamine agonist that effectively suppresses prolactin levels and milk formation. This is the most suitable medical treatment given the persistent nature of the galactorrhea."

      "explanation": "Puberty is a period of significant physiological changes, including a growth spurt, the onset of menstruation, and initial anovulatory cycles. It also involves changes in body composition. However, during puberty, pituitary FSH secretion actually starts to rise in response to GnRH stimulation to initiate follicular development. Therefore, a characteristic reduction in FSH is incorrect."

The textbook states that purified urinary FSH is \"more suitable for cases with high endogenous LH as those of PCOD, to minimize possibility of severe OHSS\". This implies that PCOS patients are inherently at a higher risk for OHSS during ovarian stimulation protocols (like those used for ICSI), requiring specific strategies to mitigate this risk. PCOS involves a large number of small follicles, making the ovaries particularly responsive to stimulation, thereby increasing the risk of overstimulation."
