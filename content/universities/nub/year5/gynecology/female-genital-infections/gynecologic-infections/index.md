### **VAGINAL FLORA AND VAGINAL PH**

The normal vaginal flora in a reproductive-age woman includes multiple aerobic, facultative, and obligate anaerobic species.
* **Lactobacillus acidophilus is the dominant bacterium in a healthy vagina (MCQ).** It plays a critical role in maintaining the normal vaginal environment by:
    * Producing **lactic acid**, which is responsible for the **acidic vaginal environment (pH: 3.8-4.5) (MCQ)**.
    * Producing lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which are toxic to anaerobic bacteria.
* A decreased glycogen content (as in menopause or childhood) leads to diminished acid production and a rise in vaginal pH, making it alkaline.

#### **NATURAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS AGAINST GENITAL TRACT INFECTION (GTI)**

* **Vaginal PH**: The **slightly acidic vaginal pH** acts as an unfavorable medium for many pathogens **(MCQ)**.
* **Vaginal epithelium**: The thick stratified squamous epithelium is protective. Normal estrogen levels prevent atrophic changes.
* **Cellular and Humoral immunity**: These play a role in normal vaginal defense.

#### **FACTORS THAT PREDISPOSE TO VAGINAL INFECTIONS**

1.  **Alterations in the normal vaginal pH**:
    * Menstrual blood flow (more alkaline).
    * Vaginal douching.
    * Decreased estrogen (childhood and menopause).
    * Sexual intercourse (alkaline semen).
2.  **Imbalance between vaginal bacterial flora and Candida species**:
    * As with recent treatment with **broad-spectrum antibiotics (MCQ)**.
3.  **Decreased resistance of vaginal epithelium**:
    * Atrophic epithelium (childhood and menopause).
    * Introduction of new organisms (STDs).
    * Foreign bodies (tampons, IUD threads).
4.  **Suppression of immune system**:
    * HIV infections, autoimmune disorders, corticosteroid therapy, and **diabetes mellitus** can result in recurrent vaginal infections, especially candidiasis **(MCQ)**.

### **COMMON TYPES OF VAGINITIS**

Vaginitis is a common complaint occurring at different periods of a woman's life.
* **In the childbearing period**:
    * Bacterial vaginosis (BV).
    * Candida vaginitis (CV).
    * Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).
* **In childhood**: Vulvovaginitis of childhood.
* **In menopausal women**: Senile or Atrophic vaginitis.

#### **Lower Genital Tract Infections in Childbearing period**

**1. BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS**

* **Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest bacterial vaginal infection** and the **commonest cause for non-irritant, malodorous vaginal discharge (MCQ)**.
* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:
    * Anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina, including **Gardnerella vaginalis (GV)**, Bacteroides species, and Mycoplasma hominis.
* BV represents an alteration of normal vaginal flora where:
    * **Anaerobic organisms markedly increase (MCQ)**.
    * Hydrogen peroxide-producing **lactobacilli markedly decrease or disappear (MCQ)**.
    * **The vaginal pH rises, ranging from 4.7-7.0 (alkaline) (MCQ)**.
    * Anaerobic bacteria produce amines, resulting in a **characteristic fishy odor discharge (MCQ)**.
* BV is not sexually acquired; the sexual partner does not need to be treated.
* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:
    * Asymptomatic in 50% of women.
    * Vaginal discharge is the commonest symptom: profuse, thin, homogenous, non-irritant, with a **malodorous, fishy amine smell**, especially around menses or after intercourse **(MCQ)**.
* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS (AMSEL'S CRITERIA)**: Requires at least 3 of the following 4 criteria:
    1.  Characteristic vaginal discharge.
    2.  Microscopic examination reveals **characteristic clue cells (MCQ)**.
    3.  Adding 10% KOH releases a **characteristic fishy odor (whiff test) (MCQ)**.
    4.  **Vaginal pH > 4.5 (MCQ)**.
* **TREATMENT OF BV (CDC 2021)**:
    * **Oral Preparations**: **Metronidazole** tablets: 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.
    * **Intravaginal Preparations**: **Clindamycin cream** vaginally daily for 7 days.
    * **During Pregnancy**: **Vaginal Clindamycin may be used from the first trimester**. **Oral Metronidazole may be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.
* **Ν.Β.**: Women with BV are at increased risk for second-trimester abortion, preterm labor, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

**2. CANDIDA VAGINITIS**

* Candida vaginitis (Candidiasis or Moniliasis) is the second most common cause of childbearing period vaginitis. It flourishes in acidic media.
* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:
    * **Candida albicans** is the causative organism in > 80% of cases. It is a normal inhabitant of the bowel and peri-anal region.
    * Non-albicans strains are less common and usually resistant to standard antifungal treatment.
* **PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR SYMPTOMATIC INFECTION**:
    * Alteration of vaginal pH to more acidic.
    * **Altered host immunity**: **Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus**, long-term corticosteroid therapy, and **HIV infection (MCQ)**.
    * **Altered microbiology**: **Long-term use of antibiotics** or chemotherapy **(MCQ)**.
    * Wetness and moisture.
* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:
    * **Vulvar pruritis**: Itching and progressive scratching is usually the main symptom **(MCQ)**.
    * **Vaginal soreness**: Burning sensation that may cause discomfort and dyspareunia.
    * **Vaginal discharge**: **scanty, thick, odorless, white discharge (cottage cheese discharge) (MCQ)**.
    * **Vulvar erythema**: red and swollen, sometimes with **fissures and excoriations (MCQ)**.
* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:
    * **Vaginal pH is slightly acidic (< 4.5) (MCQ)**.
    * Microscopic examination with saline and 10% KOH reveals hyphae or pseudo-hyphae.
    * Vaginal swabs for culture are not necessary except in resistant or recurrent infection.
* **TREATMENT OF VAGINAL CANDIDIASIS (CDC 2021)**:
    * **Non-complicated cases**:
        * **Oral preparations**: **Fluconazole**; Single oral dose 150 mg **(MCQ)**.
        * **Intravaginal preparations**: **Clotrimazole cream, OR Tioconazole ointment OR Terconazole vaginal suppository (MCQ)**.
        * **During pregnancy**: **Only intravaginal treatment for CV is considered safe throughout pregnancy**.
    * **Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally weekly dose for 6 weeks.
* **N.B.**: Routine treatment of sexual partners is not recommended, except in symptomatic partners.

**3. TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS VAGINITIS**

* Trichomoniasis is the 3rd most common cause for vaginitis. It is a multifocal infection involving the vaginal epithelium, Skene's glands, Bartholin gland, and urethra.
* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISM**:
    * **Trichomonas vaginalis (TV): an ovoid, motile, flagellated protozoon (MCQ)**.
* **Sexual transmission**: In 70% of cases, TV can be recovered from male partners, hence it is considered a **sexually transmitted disease (STD) (MCQ)**.
* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms and Signs)**:
    * **Asymptomatic in 70%-85% of women (MCQ)**.
    * **Vaginal discharge**: **Copious, yellow or green, frothy, offensive (MCQ)**.
    * **Vulval irritation** causing burning pain and dyspareunia.
    * Speculum examination reveals vaginal or cervical punctate hemorrhages in 25% of cases, also known as **strawberry spots (MCQ)**.
* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:
    * Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is the most sensitive.
    * **Saline wet mount preparations** of the vaginal discharge reveal numerous leukocytes and **highly motile flagellated trichomonads (MCQ)**.
    * Cultures from vaginal discharge.
    * Pap smear.
* **TREATMENT (CDC 2021)**:
    * Recommended regimen: **Metronidazole: 2g single oral dose for both partners (MCQ)**.
    * **During Pregnancy**: **Oral Metronidazole can be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.
    * **The male sexual partner should be promptly treated by oral Metronidazole to prevent re-infection (MCQ)**.
    * Re-testing for the female partner is recommended after 3 months due to high rates of re-infection.

#### **CHILDHOOD VAGINITIS**

* Childhood vulvovaginitis is rare, occurring mostly due to decreased vaginal wall resistance from low estrogen and low vaginal pH.
* **RISK FACTORS**: Poor hygiene, **foreign body (MCQ)**, Pinworms.
* **CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**: Bacterial infection (E. coli, streptococci), rare CV and TV.
* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: Purulent, foul odor, sometimes bloody discharge. Pruritus vulvae.
* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**: Culture and sensitivity, U.S./X-ray for foreign body.
* **TREATMENT**: Local cleanliness, systemic antibiotics, and **removal of foreign body in the vagina under anesthesia (MCQ)**.

#### **ATROPHIC VAGINITIS**

* Occurs due to loss of the normal protective thickness of the vaginal epithelium with **decreased estrogen levels (MCQ)**. It is often seen in **postmenopausal women** (senile vaginitis) and breastfeeding women.
* The vaginal epithelium becomes thin, glycogen content decreases, and **pH becomes alkaline**.
* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: **Leucorrhea, pruritus, vaginal burning, tenderness, and dyspareunia (MCQ)**. Speculum examination shows atrophic, inflamed walls. **Vaginal pH is alkaline > 4.5**.
* **TREATMENT**:
    * Systemic antibiotics if secondarily infected.

    * Endogenous bacteria (Aerobic and Anaerobic).
* **ROUTES OF INFECTION**:
    1.  **Ascending infection from endocervicitis (gonorrhea & chlamydia) is the commonest route (MCQ)**.
    2.  Direct or lymphatic extension from GIT conditions.
    3.  Blood borne extension from pulmonary T.B. (rarely).
* **RISK FACTORS**:
    * **Factors associated with increased risk for PID**: Young age (25-35 years), **multiple sexual partners**, **use of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) (MCQ)**.
    * **Factors associated with decreased risk for PID**: **Barrier methods** (male condom), **Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (MCQ)**.
