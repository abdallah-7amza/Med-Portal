      "summary": "This lesson covers the normal vaginal flora and pH, focusing on Lactobacillus acidophilus, which maintains an acidic environment (pH 3.8-4.5). It explores natural defenses, predisposing factors for infections, and details common types of vaginitis, cervicitis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).",
      "markdownContent": "\n### **VAGINAL FLORA AND VAGINAL PH**\n\nThe normal vaginal flora in a reproductive-age woman includes multiple aerobic, facultative, and obligate anaerobic species.\n* **Lactobacillus acidophilus is the dominant bacterium in a healthy vagina (MCQ).** It plays a critical role in maintaining the normal vaginal environment by:\n    * Producing **lactic acid**, which is responsible for the **acidic vaginal environment (pH: 3.8-4.5) (MCQ)**.\n    * Producing lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which are toxic to anaerobic bacteria.\n* A decreased glycogen content (as in menopause or childhood) leads to diminished acid production and a rise in vaginal pH, making it alkaline.\n\n#### **NATURAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS AGAINST GENITAL TRACT INFECTION (GTI)**\n\n* **Vaginal PH**: The **slightly acidic vaginal pH** acts as an unfavorable medium for many pathogens **(MCQ)**.\n* **Vaginal epithelium**: The thick stratified squamous epithelium is protective. Normal estrogen levels prevent atrophic changes.\n* **Cellular and Humoral immunity**: These play a role in normal vaginal defense.\n\n#### **FACTORS THAT PREDISPOSE TO VAGINAL INFECTIONS**\n\n1.  **Alterations in the normal vaginal pH**:\n    * Menstrual blood flow (more alkaline).\n    * Vaginal douching.\n    * Decreased estrogen (childhood and menopause).\n    * Sexual intercourse (alkaline semen).\n2.  **Imbalance between vaginal bacterial flora and Candida species**:\n    * As with recent treatment with **broad-spectrum antibiotics (MCQ)**.\n3.  **Decreased resistance of vaginal epithelium**:\n    * Atrophic epithelium (childhood and menopause).\n    * Introduction of new organisms (STDs).\n    * Foreign bodies (tampons, IUD threads).\n4.  **Suppression of immune system**:\n    * HIV infections, autoimmune disorders, corticosteroid therapy, and **diabetes mellitus** can result in recurrent vaginal infections, especially candidiasis **(MCQ)**.\n\n### **COMMON TYPES OF VAGINITIS**\n\nVaginitis is a common complaint occurring at different periods of a woman's life.\n* **In the childbearing period**:\n    * Bacterial vaginosis (BV).\n    * Candida vaginitis (CV).\n    * Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).\n* **In childhood**: Vulvovaginitis of childhood.\n* **In menopausal women**: Senile or Atrophic vaginitis.\n\n#### **Lower Genital Tract Infections in Childbearing period**\n\n**1. BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS**\n\n* **Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest bacterial vaginal infection** and the **commonest cause for non-irritant, malodorous vaginal discharge (MCQ)**.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:\n    * Anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina, including **Gardnerella vaginalis (GV)**, Bacteroides species, and Mycoplasma hominis.\n* BV represents an alteration of normal vaginal flora where:\n    * **Anaerobic organisms markedly increase (MCQ)**.\n    * Hydrogen peroxide-producing **lactobacilli markedly decrease or disappear (MCQ)**.\n    * **The vaginal pH rises, ranging from 4.7-7.0 (alkaline) (MCQ)**.\n    * Anaerobic bacteria produce amines, resulting in a **characteristic fishy odor discharge (MCQ)**.\n* BV is not sexually acquired; the sexual partner does not need to be treated.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:\n    * Asymptomatic in 50% of women.\n    * Vaginal discharge is the commonest symptom: profuse, thin, homogenous, non-irritant, with a **malodorous, fishy amine smell**, especially around menses or after intercourse **(MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS (AMSEL'S CRITERIA)**: Requires at least 3 of the following 4 criteria:\n    1.  Characteristic vaginal discharge.\n    2.  Microscopic examination reveals **characteristic clue cells (MCQ)**.\n    3.  Adding 10% KOH releases a **characteristic fishy odor (whiff test) (MCQ)**.\n    4.  **Vaginal pH > 4.5 (MCQ)**.\n* **TREATMENT OF BV (CDC 2021)**:\n    * **Oral Preparations**: **Metronidazole** tablets: 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.\n    * **Intravaginal Preparations**: **Clindamycin cream** vaginally daily for 7 days.\n    * **During Pregnancy**: **Vaginal Clindamycin may be used from the first trimester**. **Oral Metronidazole may be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.\n* **Ν.Β.**: Women with BV are at increased risk for second-trimester abortion, preterm labor, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\n**2. CANDIDA VAGINITIS**\n\n* Candida vaginitis (Candidiasis or Moniliasis) is the second most common cause of childbearing period vaginitis. It flourishes in acidic media.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**:\n    * **Candida albicans** is the causative organism in > 80% of cases. It is a normal inhabitant of the bowel and peri-anal region.\n    * Non-albicans strains are less common and usually resistant to standard antifungal treatment.\n* **PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR SYMPTOMATIC INFECTION**:\n    * Alteration of vaginal pH to more acidic.\n    * **Altered host immunity**: **Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus**, long-term corticosteroid therapy, and **HIV infection (MCQ)**.\n    * **Altered microbiology**: **Long-term use of antibiotics** or chemotherapy **(MCQ)**.\n    * Wetness and moisture.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms & Signs)**:\n    * **Vulvar pruritis**: Itching and progressive scratching is usually the main symptom **(MCQ)**.\n    * **Vaginal soreness**: Burning sensation that may cause discomfort and dyspareunia.\n    * **Vaginal discharge**: **scanty, thick, odorless, white discharge (cottage cheese discharge) (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vulvar erythema**: red and swollen, sometimes with **fissures and excoriations (MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:\n    * **Vaginal pH is slightly acidic (< 4.5) (MCQ)**.\n    * Microscopic examination with saline and 10% KOH reveals hyphae or pseudo-hyphae.\n    * Vaginal swabs for culture are not necessary except in resistant or recurrent infection.\n* **TREATMENT OF VAGINAL CANDIDIASIS (CDC 2021)**:\n    * **Non-complicated cases**:\n        * **Oral preparations**: **Fluconazole**; Single oral dose 150 mg **(MCQ)**.\n        * **Intravaginal preparations**: **Clotrimazole cream, OR Tioconazole ointment OR Terconazole vaginal suppository (MCQ)**.\n        * **During pregnancy**: **Only intravaginal treatment for CV is considered safe throughout pregnancy**.\n    * **Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis**: Fluconazole 150 mg orally weekly dose for 6 weeks.\n* **N.B.**: Routine treatment of sexual partners is not recommended, except in symptomatic partners.\n\n**3. TRICHOMONAS VAGINALIS VAGINITIS**\n\n* Trichomoniasis is the 3rd most common cause for vaginitis. It is a multifocal infection involving the vaginal epithelium, Skene's glands, Bartholin gland, and urethra.\n* **ETIOLOGY AND CAUSATIVE ORGANISM**:\n    * **Trichomonas vaginalis (TV): an ovoid, motile, flagellated protozoon (MCQ)**.\n* **Sexual transmission**: In 70% of cases, TV can be recovered from male partners, hence it is considered a **sexually transmitted disease (STD) (MCQ)**.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE (Symptoms and Signs)**:\n    * **Asymptomatic in 70%-85% of women (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vaginal discharge**: **Copious, yellow or green, frothy, offensive (MCQ)**.\n    * **Vulval irritation** causing burning pain and dyspareunia.\n    * Speculum examination reveals vaginal or cervical punctate hemorrhages in 25% of cases, also known as **strawberry spots (MCQ)**.\n* **DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS**:\n    * Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is the most sensitive.\n    * **Saline wet mount preparations** of the vaginal discharge reveal numerous leukocytes and **highly motile flagellated trichomonads (MCQ)**.\n    * Cultures from vaginal discharge.\n    * Pap smear.\n* **TREATMENT (CDC 2021)**:\n    * Recommended regimen: **Metronidazole: 2g single oral dose for both partners (MCQ)**.\n    * **During Pregnancy**: **Oral Metronidazole can be used after the first trimester (MCQ)**.\n    * **The male sexual partner should be promptly treated by oral Metronidazole to prevent re-infection (MCQ)**.\n    * Re-testing for the female partner is recommended after 3 months due to high rates of re-infection.\n\n#### **CHILDHOOD VAGINITIS**\n\n* Childhood vulvovaginitis is rare, occurring mostly due to decreased vaginal wall resistance from low estrogen and low vaginal pH.\n* **RISK FACTORS**: Poor hygiene, **foreign body (MCQ)**, Pinworms.\n* **CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS**: Bacterial infection (E. coli, streptococci), rare CV and TV.\n* **CLINICAL PICTURE**: Purulent, foul odor, sometimes bloody discharge.
