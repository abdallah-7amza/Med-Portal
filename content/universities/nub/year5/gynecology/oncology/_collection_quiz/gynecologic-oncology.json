      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Uterine leiomyomas commonly present with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), particularly heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), especially with submucous and large multiple interstitial myomas. Other symptoms include pelvic pain (if complicated), recurrent pregnancy loss or infertility due to distortion of the uterine cavity or tubal obstruction, and progressive abdominal enlargement which can manifest as a pelvic mass. Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is not listed as a typical presentation of uterine leiomyomas in the sources."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Leiomyomas are estrogen-dependent tumors. Risk factors include low parity (nulliparous and low parity women), Afro-American race, and a positive family history of the disease. Late menarche, which would imply less estrogen exposure over a lifetime, is not listed as a risk factor; in fact, an abundant estrogen environment is noted as an etiological factor. Endometriosis is mentioned as a separate condition, not a risk factor for uterine myomas."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Up to 95% of leiomyomas develop within the myometrium of the uterine body. These corporeal leiomyomas are classified based on their relation to the uterine mucosa, including interstitial myomas (ISM), which are located within the center of the myometrium. While subserosal and submucosal are also sites, interstitial (or intramural, Type 4 in FIGO classification) is the primary location within the uterine wall from which many fibroids originate or are primarily situated."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Red degeneration (necrobiosis) is the commonest change during pregnancy, possibly due to the tumor outgrowing its blood supply, leading to incomplete necrosis. Clinically, it presents with enlargement, tenderness, acute pelvic pain, and mild pyrexia. Its management is essentially conservative, involving rest and analgesics (NSAIDs). Surgical treatment is generally avoided due to increased vascularity during pregnancy."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Malignant transformation into leiomyosarcoma is very rare (less than 0.1% of myomas). Sarcoma is suspected when tumors exhibit rapid growth without evidence of degeneration, when they first appear or increase in size in the menopause, or when they present with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB). Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and pressure symptoms are common presentations of benign fibroids and do not solely indicate malignancy."

Polycythemia (an increase in red blood cells) is not mentioned as a complication of uterine fibroids in the sources."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Common clinical presentations of uterine fibroids include menorrhagia (most common symptom), pelvic pain (if complicated), infertility, and recurrent abortion. Ureteral obstruction can occur with large broad ligament myomas, but it is not listed as a common clinical presentation for uterine fibroids in general."

        "Fibroid is never detected by x ray.",
        "None of the above."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Submucous fibroids (SMM) indent the endometrial lining and encroach on the endometrial cavity, making them detectable by hysteroscopy which allows visualization of the uterine cavity. Subserous fibroids (SSM) raise the peritoneal covering of the uterus externally and are best detected by ultrasound (US). Interstitial myomas (ISM) are within the myometrium and are also detectable by US. X-rays can detect calcification in long-standing myomas, appearing as an 'egg shell appearance'. Laparoscopy allows direct inspection of pelvic organs, including the external surface of the uterus, for SSM and abdominal fibroids. Therefore, none of the given options are entirely accurate as single true statements."

        "Abdominal myomectomy is difficult."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cervical leiomyomas represent less than 5% of uterine myomas and are usually solitary. They can grow upwards in the true pelvis, in relation to the urinary bladder and ureters, potentially causing ureteric compression and affection of renal function or retention of urine. They may also cause infertility. Preoperative IVP (intravenous pyelography) is essential to assess the ureters before surgical removal due to their close anatomical relationship. Abdominal myomectomy for cervical fibroids can be difficult due to these anatomical relations. Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) is the commonest symptom for corporeal myomas, especially SMM, not typically for cervical fibroids."

        "The risk of recurrent fibroid is 50%."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Consent for hysterectomy is usually taken before abdominal myomectomy due to the risk of excessive blood loss during the operation, which might necessitate a hysterectomy to control bleeding and save the patient's life. Fibroids are not typically associated with theca lutein cysts or pyosalpinx. Myomectomy is contraindicated after menopause due to suspicion of malignancy. Recurrence of fibroids may occur in up to 30% of cases."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Uterine leiomyomas can lead to obstructed labor, especially if they are large or positioned to impede the birth canal. Myomectomy is generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to increased uterine vascularity and risk of hemorrhage, and myomas typically decrease in size after puerperium. They commonly cause abdominal pain (red degeneration) during pregnancy."

They may be asymptomatic or produce a variety of gynecological symptoms. They are seen more frequently in Afro-American races. However, their malignant transformation into leiomyosarcoma is very rare, occurring in less than 0.1% of myomas, indicating a very low, not high, malignant potential."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) is the commonest symptom for myomas, especially with submucous myomas (SMM) and large multiple interstitial myomas. SMM indent the endometrial lining and encroach on the endometrial cavity, mechanically interfering with uterine contraction and increasing the endometrial surface area, leading to excessive bleeding. The presentation of menorrhagia with an enlarged uterus is highly suggestive of this type. Anemia (low hemoglobin) is a direct consequence of heavy bleeding."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "For a 50-year-old multiparous woman (P1+2) with heavy menstrual bleeding due to a submucous fibroid filling the uterine cavity, hysterectomy is the definitive surgical treatment. Given her age and completed family, preserving the uterus is less of a priority, and hysterectomy offers a permanent solution, especially when myomectomy might be difficult or associated with recurrence. Other treatments like LHRH analogues or gestagens are medical and temporary, and while myomectomy is an option to preserve fertility, it's less suitable for an older multiparous woman with a large SMM filling the cavity where permanent resolution is often desired. LNG-IUS is effective for DUB but may not be sufficient for a large SMM."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding) can be caused by leiomyomas, but also by associated endometrial hyperplasia (EH) or endometrial/endocervical carcinomas. An endometrial thickness of 13mm in a 45-year-old woman with AUB (metrorrhagia) is suspicious for endometrial hyperplasia (EH). Therefore, the gold standard for diagnosis of EH or endometrial carcinoma is fractional curettage or endometrial biopsy to exclude malignancy before definitive treatment for the fibroid."

      "explanation": "Red degeneration (necrobiosis) is the commonest change during pregnancy. It presents with acute pelvic pain. The management is essentially conservative by rest and analgesics as NSAIDs. Immediate pregnancy termination or myomectomy during pregnancy are generally contraindicated due to the risks involved. GnRH analogues and antibiotics are not the primary first-line treatment for red degeneration itself."

However, intervention is required if the leiomyoma reaches a large size (> 14 weeks), is a broad ligament myoma (BLM) (due to risk of ureteric compression and renal function affection), is a submucous myoma (SMM) in infertile patients or those with recurrent pregnancy loss, or causes severe symptoms.

It is specifically indicated for the removal of small submucous myomas protruding into the uterine cavity, offering minimal pain and bleeding with a short recovery period, making it ideal for fertility preservation. Open abdominal myomectomy is for larger and multiple myomas, and laparoscopic myomectomy is mainly for subserous myomas. Medical treatments are temporary and may not be effective for a fibroid of this size and location."
