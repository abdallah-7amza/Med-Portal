        "Asherman syndrome"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Females with Mullerian agenesis (MRKH Syndrome) have a 46,XX karyotype and congenital failure of development of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. They have normal ovaries that are capable of producing normal amounts of estrogen."

        "Axillary & pubic hair growth",
        "Endometrial proliferation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Estrogen contributes to breast development, uterine growth, and endometrial proliferation. However, axillary and pubic hair growth occurs under the effect of ACTH and androgens, not estrogen."

      "options": [
        "Estrogen and Progesterone",
        "FSH and LH",
        "Prolactin"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "After menopause, there is a marked increase in serum FSH & LH levels due to the depletion of ovarian primordial follicles and subsequent cessation of ovarian estrogen (E2) secretion, releasing the pituitary gland from negative feedback."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Precocious puberty describes the appearance of secondary sexual characters before 8 years of age. If there is vaginal bleeding and breast enlargement (signs of estrogen effect) but no axillary or pubic hair (which would be influenced by androgens), it suggests a source of estrogen that is not also producing androgens, such as an estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Imperforate hymen can cause primary amenorrhea and cyclic, monthly abdominal pain due to accumulation of menstrual blood (hematocolpos and hematometra). Short stature is a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, not imperforate hymen."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "In congenital cervical atresia, failure of canalization of the cervical canal leads to accumulation of menstrual blood, resulting in marked hematometra (blood in uterus) but no hematocolpos (blood in vagina) because the cervix is blocked. The source does not list hematosalpinx as a feature present in cervical atresia."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Mild oligospermia is listed as an indication for Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI). IVF/ICSI is indicated for severe male factor, failed IUI, severe tubal adhesions, and unexplained infertility."

        "Azoospermia",
        "Unexplained infertility"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "IVF, particularly with ICSI, is indicated for tubal blockage, severe male factor, and unexplained infertility. While severe male factor is an indication, the question implies azoospermia as an exception, potentially because it may require additional procedures for sperm retrieval or donor sperm, which fall outside the typical direct 'use' of IVF without preliminary steps."

      "explanation": "Common symptoms of endometriosis include dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, as well as chronic pelvic pain.

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Damage to the pituitary stalk will result in hypopituitarism for FSH, LH, GH, ACTH, and TSH, but with an associated increase in PRL (prolactin) secretion because prolactin is under chronic inhibition by prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF)."

      "explanation": "Causes of hyperprolactinemia include pregnancy, lactation, drug-induced effects (e.g., psychotropic drugs reducing dopamine), primary hypothyroidism, pituitary adenomas, and hypothalamic disorders. Dopamine agonists are actually used as treatment for hyperprolactinemia because dopamine is the prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF)."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are both listed as causes of anovulation. Asherman syndrome is characterized by acquired intrauterine adhesions that prevent endometrial proliferation, leading to secondary amenorrhea, but it is not a primary cause of anovulation; rather, it's a uterine factor."

      "explanation": "Investigations for Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome include karyotyping (revealing 46, XY) and pelvic ultrasound (revealing absent uterus and small or absent vagina, with testes possibly in inguinal region).

However, the presence of a fibroid at the fundus, especially if not described as large or interfering with insertion, does not automatically contraindicate IUD replacement, implying that it can be replaced as long as proper placement is ensured.
