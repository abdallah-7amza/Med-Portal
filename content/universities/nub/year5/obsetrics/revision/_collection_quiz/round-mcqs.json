      "options": [
        "Give methotrexate",
        "Immediate surgery",
        "Repeat hCG and US after 48 hours"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An intrauterine pregnancy should typically be visible on transvaginal ultrasound when hCG levels reach 1500 IU/mL. Since the level is below this 'discriminatory zone,' it's necessary to repeat the hCG level after 48 hours to check for the appropriate doubling time of a viable intrauterine pregnancy."

        "Follicular cyst"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Theca-lutein cysts occur in 25-60% of complete molar pregnancies due to ovarian hyperstimulation from the very high levels of hCG produced by the trophoblastic cells."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Diagnosis of Down syndrome in the first trimester is suggested by:",
      "options": [

      "options": [
        "Transport of nutrients and toxins",
        "Immunity acceptance",
        "Secretion of hormones",
        "Initiating uterine contractions for labor"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The placenta's main functions are nutrient transfer, endocrine/metabolic activity (hormone production), and immunological protection. While placental hormones are involved in the process leading to labor, the placenta itself does not directly initiate uterine contractions."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The maternal part of the placenta is formed from the:",
      "options": [
        "Decidua basalis",

    },
    {
      "stem": "Cervical incompetence is typically managed by:",
      "options": [
        "Progesterone supplements",
        "Bed rest only",
        "Cervical cerclage"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The standard treatment for cervical incompetence during pregnancy is a cerclage operation, which involves placing a circumferential suture around the cervix to reinforce it."

      "stem": "What is the first thing to be done before the second stage of labor begins?",
      "options": [
        "Administer anesthesia",
        "Evacuate the bladder",
        "Start an oxytocin drip"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Ensuring the bladder is empty, either by spontaneous voiding or catheterization, is a key first step in managing the second stage of labor to allow for fetal descent."

      "options": [
        "Uterine atony",
        "Retained placental fragments",
        "Genital tract laceration"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If postpartum hemorrhage occurs while the uterus is firmly contracted, the cause is likely traumatic (e.g., a cervical, vaginal, or perineal laceration) rather than atonic (a soft, boggy uterus) or from retained products."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The relation of the fetal parts to one another is defined as:",
      "options": [
        "Fetal lie",
        "Fetal attitude",
        "Fetal position"

        "Occipitofrontal (11.5 cm)",
        "Mentovertical (13.5 cm)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In a brow presentation, the head is partially extended, presenting the mentovertical diameter (13.5 cm), which is too large to pass through the maternal pelvis, causing obstructed labor."
    },
    {
      "stem": "What is the single most common cause of breech presentation at term?",
      "options": [
        "Idiopathic",
        "Preterm labor",
        "Uterine anomalies"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "While prematurity is a major factor, in at least one-third of breech presentations at term, no specific underlying cause can be identified, making it idiopathic."

        "Complete breech in a multipara"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A footling breech is an indication for Cesarean section due to the high risk of umbilical cord prolapse and the presenting part being a poor dilating wedge."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Management for a persistent occipito-posterior (OP) position with arrest of descent is often:",
      "options": [
        "Manual rotation",
        "Cesarean section",
        "Application of forceps"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When the fetal head fails to rotate from an OP position and descent arrests (deep transverse arrest), labor becomes obstructed. A Cesarean section is often the safest mode of delivery."
    },
    {
      "stem": "In a multiparous woman, obstructed labor can eventually lead to:",
      "options": [
        "Hypotonic uterine inertia",
        "Hypertonic inertia",
        "Uterine rupture"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Obstructed labor places immense strain on the lower uterine segment, which can lead to thinning and eventual rupture, a life-threatening obstetric emergency."

      "options": [
        "A scar from a previous Cesarean section",
        "Grand multiparity",
        "Obstructed labor"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The presence of a uterine scar, most commonly from a previous Cesarean section, is the single most significant risk factor for uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Upon diagnosing a cord prolapse, what is the IMMEDIATE first step?",
      "options": [
        "Manually elevate the presenting fetal part to relieve pressure on the cord.",
        "Place the mother in the Trendelenburg position.",
        "Rush the patient for immediate Cesarean section."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The immediate first aid measure for a cord prolapse is to manually lift the presenting fetal part off the umbilical cord to restore blood flow to the fetus while preparing for emergency delivery."
    },
    {
      "stem": "A 23-year-old at 42 weeks gestation has a favorable cervix (soft, 2 cm dilated, 50% effaced). What is the recommended management?",

        "Immediate caesarian section",
        "Induction by vaginal misoprostol",
        "Oxytocin infusion and artificial rupture of membranes",
        "Continue monitoring for another week"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "At 42 weeks (post-term pregnancy), induction of labor is indicated. Since the cervix is favorable (high Bishop score), cervical ripening with prostaglandins is not needed, and induction can proceed directly with an oxytocin infusion and/or amniotomy."
    },
    {
      "stem": "What does the obstetrical history G3P2L2 mean?",
      "options": [
        "Three pregnancies, two births, two living children",
