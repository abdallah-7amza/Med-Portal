        "Hydrops fetalis."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In cases of placenta membranacea, the placenta is large and thin, which increases the likelihood that a part of it may be implanted over the lower uterine segment, leading to placenta previa and potential antepartum hemorrhage."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A succenturiate placenta consists of a main part and a smaller, separate accessory part. This accessory part may be retained in the uterus after delivery, leading to postpartum hemorrhage."

        "Hemolysis.",
        "Decreased erythropoiesis."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "During pregnancy, the increase in plasma volume is greater than the increase in red blood cell mass, resulting in hemodilution, which is commonly referred to as physiologic anemia of pregnancy and causes a lowered hemoglobin concentration."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The total blood volume increases during pregnancy, with the plasma volume increasing more significantly than the red blood cell volume. This disproportionate increase leads to hemodilution."

      "explanation": "The textbook states that anemia during pregnancy is diagnosed with hemoglobin levels < 11 gm/dl in the 1st and 3rd trimesters, and < 10.5 gm/dl in the 2nd trimester. For a woman at 28 weeks of gestation (which is the end of the 2nd trimester), the specific threshold would ideally be <10.5 g/dl. However, given the provided options, and 10.5 g/dl not being an option, 11 g/dl is presented as the correct answer and represents a common, though slightly broader, threshold for anemia in pregnancy."

        "Blood pressure reading of 140/90 in late pregnancy is considered normal."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A slight drop in blood pressure normally occurs during the 2nd trimester (mid-pregnancy) due to the opening of arterio-venous shunts in the placenta."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "During pregnancy, while the thyroid gland increases in size and activity (physiological goitre) and total T4 levels rise, the free T4 levels remain within normal ranges. By inference, free T3 levels are also expected to remain unchanged to maintain euthyroid state."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Normal urinary tract changes in pregnancy include dilatation of the ureters (more on the right side), urine stasis, and decreased bladder capacity due to uterine pressure. An increased creatinine level is typically indicative of renal insufficiency, a pathological condition (e.g., in severe preeclampsia), rather than a normal physiological change in pregnancy where creatinine levels usually decrease due to increased glomerular filtration."

        "Ketonuria."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Pregnancy induces a \"diabetogenic state\" in carbohydrate metabolism. This state is often associated with a decreased renal threshold for glucose, leading to glucosuria even with normal blood glucose levels. Proteinuria and ketonuria are generally signs of pathology, not normal pregnancy."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The cervix undergoes several changes during pregnancy, including edema, congestion, and the formation of a mucus plug. Hormonal erosion may also occur, which can lead to benign cellular changes that might be interpreted as atypical on a Pap smear but are considered physiological."

      "explanation": "While breast size, vascularity, pigmentation of the nipple and areola, and the appearance of Montgomery tubercles and a secondary areola all increase during pregnancy, only colostrum-like fluid is expressed at the end of the 4th month, not profuse milk expression. Profuse milk production (lactation) begins postpartum."

      "explanation": "Even though breast changes are common in pregnancy, the textbook emphasizes the importance of discriminating between normal pregnancy symptoms and those related to pathological conditions. A persistent breast lump, regardless of the patient's age or pregnancy status, necessitates further investigation, such as a biopsy, to rule out any underlying pathology."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The textbook highlights that measurements of fetal crown to rump length (CRL) from first-trimester ultrasound provide the most accurate dating of pregnancy. This implies that dating based on early ultrasound is more accurate than relying solely on the LMP. While early ultrasound is the gold standard, the option specifically contrasts LMP with late ultrasound. Late ultrasound measurements for dating become less accurate due to wider variations in fetal growth. Therefore, if comparing LMP to late US, LMP-derived dates, when reliable, are considered more accurate than late US."

      "explanation": "When the last menstrual period (LMP) is unreliable, such as during lactation amenorrhea, measurements of fetal crown to rump length (CRL) from first-trimester ultrasound provide the most accurate dating of pregnancy. Early fetal biometry by ultrasound is superior for estimating gestational age in such cases."

      "explanation": "While early ultrasound can identify the placental location, the definitive diagnosis of placenta previa is often not made in early pregnancy because of the phenomenon of \"placental migration,\" where a low-lying placenta noted early on may appear to move upwards as the lower uterine segment develops.
