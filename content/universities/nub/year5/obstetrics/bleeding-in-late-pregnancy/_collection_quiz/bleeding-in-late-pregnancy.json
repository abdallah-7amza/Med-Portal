        "Genital bleeding after fetal viability till fetal delivery."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) is explicitly defined as bleeding occurring after fetal viability till delivery (i.e.; bleeding between 24-40 weeks)."

        "Rupture vasa previa",
        "Associated gynecologic lesion."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "While the provided key answer identifies Placenta previa as the most common cause of antepartum hemorrhage, the comprehensive 'Obstetric Department Book 2025.pdf' explicitly states that Placental abruption (also known as accidental hemorrhage) is considered the most common cause for antepartum and intrapartum hemorrhage, complicating up to 1% of all pregnancies. It further notes that Placenta previa is the 2nd most common cause of APH, being preceded only by placental abruption."

        "Other associated obstetric indication as previous CS.",
        "Early rupture of membranes during labor."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "The sources indicate that all cases of Placenta previa (total, partial & marginal) will be delivered by CS. Specific indications for immediate CS include severe bleeding, gestational age > 36 weeks, and spontaneous onset of labor pains. Other associated obstetric indications, like previous CS, can also lead to CS. Early rupture of membranes during labor is not listed as an exception that would not indicate a cesarean section for placenta previa among the given options."

        "Early onset of fetal distress commonly occurs."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Bleeding in Placenta previa occurs due to the unavoidable separation of the placenta as a result of stretching of the lower uterine segment while the pregnancy is ongoing."

        "Usually mild bleeding.",
        "Rapid fetal distress is characteristic."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Vaginal bleeding in placenta previa is typically described as painless causeless recurrent vaginal bleeding, which is the most common clinical presentation."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Placenta previa is characterized by painless vaginal bleeding. Abdominal pain and tenderness are typically associated with placental abruption. Other factors listed, such as multipara, recurrent bleeding, fetal malpresentations, and twin pregnancy, are all recognized predisposing or risk factors for placenta previa."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The incidence of placenta previa, and consequently the risk of abnormally invasive placenta (like placenta accreta), rises with increasing maternal age and increasing incidence of repeated deliveries by CS. Placenta accreta occurs mostly in association with placenta previa, especially at the site of a previous CS scar, with the risk increasing proportionately with the number of previous cesarean sections."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "For placenta previa, immediate Cesarean Section (CS) is indicated in cases with severe bleeding compromising maternal or fetal lives, regardless of gestational age. Given the 'heavy vaginal bleeding' and 'total placenta previa covering the cervix' in a living fetus, CS is the definitive management."

      "explanation": "The patient is presenting with painless continuous vaginal bleeding, and vital signs indicating hypovolemic shock (BP 90/60, pulse 105 b/min). The immediate priority in managing severe bleeding and hypovolemic shock is resuscitation and anti-shock measures, which include IV infusion with saline/dextrose or lactated Ringer solution and blood or blood components. Digital examination is contraindicated in suspected placenta previa."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If the placental site bleeds heavily despite the uterus contracting, it suggests the bleeding is not primarily due to uterine atony, which would typically be managed by uterine massage and ecbolics. In cases where other methods fail to control intractable bleeding from the placental bed, bilateral internal iliac artery ligation is a described interventional method to decrease pelvic blood flow and minimize blood loss. While hysterectomy is a last resort, bilateral internal iliac ligation is an earlier surgical intervention mentioned."

        "This is insignificant as she will deliver by caesarian section.",
        "Placenta accreta should be considered.",
        "Placental insufficiency is highly expected.",
        "Immediate termination should be considered.",
        "Placenta usually migrates up."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Given the patient's history of multiple previous cesarean sections (3 CS) and the finding of a low lying anterior wall placenta, there is an increased risk of abnormally invasive placenta (Placenta Accreta Spectrum). Therefore, placenta accreta should be considered in counseling this patient."

        "Cystoscopy.",
        "(a) and (b)."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "For the diagnosis of abnormally invasive placenta (Placenta Accreta Spectrum), the sources state that diagnosis can be achieved by second level expert US (2D or 3D US and colour Doppler) and also by MRI, though with no significant benefit over expert US. Therefore, both a more professional ultrasound (a) and MRI (b) are indicated."

        "Conservative management.",
        "Urgent blood transfusion.",
        "External cephalic version."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with mild painless vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks, is vitally stable, and the ultrasound shows the placenta is 2 cm away from the cervix. This describes a 'low lying placenta (lateral PL PRV)' which carries less risk for bleeding and separation, and does not contraindicate vaginal delivery. In such cases, if bleeding is mild and not affecting maternal or fetal well-being, expectant management to delay delivery is appropriate for preterm pregnancies (< 36 weeks) to allow for lung maturity."

        "Analgesics and recheck within few days."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The ultrasound reveals a 'low-lying placenta covering the cervix'. This description indicates a Placenta previa (total or partial central PL PRV). For Placenta previa, all cases will be delivered by Cesarean Section (CS). Since the patient is full term and has placenta previa covering the cervix, an urgent CS is the appropriate management."

        "Urgent CS should be done to prevent rupture uterus.",
        "Insist to refer the case to a 3ry care hospital.",

        "IV tocolytics.",
        "Check cervical dilatation for possible vaginal delivery."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This patient has several high-risk factors: unbooked pregnancy, previous 3 Cesarean sections, 34 weeks gestation (preterm), strong uterine contractions, and a low anterior wall placenta. This combination significantly increases the risk for complications such as abnormally invasive placenta (Placenta Accreta Spectrum) and uterine rupture. High-risk cases, especially those with suspected abnormally invasive placenta, require specialized care that a 'one day surgery' medical center is unlikely to provide. Therefore, referring the case to a tertiary care hospital is the most appropriate step."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of sudden sharp continuous abdominal pain, shock, and a tender uterus without bleeding strongly suggests concealed placental abruption. In concealed type abruption, blood remains entrapped forming a retro-placental haematoma with no clinically detectable external vaginal bleeding, and it is the most serious type."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "In severe concealed accidental hemorrhage, Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC) can occur due to thromboplastin release and consumption of clotting factors in the retroplacental hematoma, leading to hypofibrinogenemia."

The Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is explicitly identified as an acquired thrombophilia and a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss and thrombosis, where antibodies lead to thrombosis of placental vessels."
