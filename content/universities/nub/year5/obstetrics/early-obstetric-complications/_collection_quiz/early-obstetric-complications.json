      "explanation": "The textbook defines spontaneous abortion as \"Termination of pregnancy before viability of the fetus (in Egypt, before 24 weeks)\" and preterm labor as \"onset of true labor pains any time after fetal viability but before 36 weeks gestation\". This indicates that viability refers to the ability of the fetus to survive outside the uterus with appropriate support. Therefore, a \"chance of survival with maximum pediatric support\" is the most accurate description of fetal viability in this context."
