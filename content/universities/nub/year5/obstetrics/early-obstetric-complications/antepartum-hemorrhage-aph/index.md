**Antepartum Hemorrhage (APH)** is bleeding that occurs after fetal viability until delivery (between 24-40 weeks). The bleeding is mostly maternal in origin, but less commonly can be fetal (vasa previa), which rapidly affects fetal wellbeing.

### **CAUSES AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF AΡΗ**

1.  **OBSTETRIC CAUSES:** (detected by ultrasound)
    * **Placental abruption:** Separation of a normally implanted placenta.
    * **Placenta Previa:** Separation of an abnormally low implanted placenta.
    * **Vasa Previa:** Bleeding from the umbilical cord (fetal origin).
2.  **GYNECOLOGICAL CAUSES:** (detected by speculum examination)
    * Vaginal trauma or lesions.
    * Benign (erosion or polyp) or malignant cervical conditions.
3.  **GENERAL OR SYSTEMIC CAUSES:** (detected from medical history)
    * Anticoagulant therapy.
    * Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
    * Severe, uncontrolled Hypertension (HTN).

### **PLACENTAL ABRUPTION**

Placental abruption is the separation of a normally implanted placenta. It complicates up to 1% of pregnancies and is the **most common cause for antepartum and intrapartum hemorrhage (MCQ)**. It is a significant cause of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), preterm labor (PTL), and may be associated with **maternal coagulopathy and DIC (MCQ)**.

#### **RISK FACTORS:**

* Abruption in a previous pregnancy.
* **Maternal hypertension and severe preeclampsia (PE) (MCQ)**.
* **Sudden ROM in cases with polyhydramnios (MCQ)**.
* Traumatic abruption from external trauma.
* **Smoking (MCQ)**.
* Thrombophilias.

#### **TYPES OF BLEEDING IN PLACENTAL ABRUPTION:**

1.  **Revealed type:** Blood dissects between membranes and is revealed externally through the vagina. **This is the commonest type (MCQ)**.
2.  **Concealed type:** Blood is trapped, forming a retro-placental haematoma with no external bleeding. **This is the least common and most serious type (MCQ)**. It is often associated with severe PE, **severe pain, a hard tender uterus, and fetal distress (MCQ)**.
3.  **Mixed type:** Bleeding is partially concealed and partially revealed.

#### **CLINICAL PICTURE:**

* **Mild separation:** Does not affect vital signs.
* **Severe separation:** Associated with hemorrhagic shock. The degree of shock may not correlate with external bleeding in **concealed or mixed types (MCQ)**.
* **DIC may occur in cases with concealed hemorrhage (MCQ)**.

#### **ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION:**

* **Uterine tenderness** is usually present.
* A **rising fundal level may be noticed in concealed hemorrhage (MCQ)** due to an accumulating retroplacental hematoma.
* **Vaginal examination should only be performed after excluding placenta previa by US (MCQ)**.

#### **DIAGNOSIS:**

* **Transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is the gold standard for identifying placental site to exclude placenta previa (MCQ)**. It can also detect a **large retroplacental haematoma in concealed cases (MCQ)**.
* Laboratory tests: CBC, coagulation profile, liver & kidney function tests.
* Assessment of fetal wellbeing (FHR tracing, CTG, Doppler US).

#### **PATHOLOGY AND COMPLICATIONS OF SEVERE PALCENTAL ABRUPTION:**

1.  **Hemorrhagic shock, which might be complicated by acute renal tubular necrosis (MCQ)**.
2.  Sheehan syndrome (acute pituitary necrosis).
3.  **DIC due to thromboplastin release from damaged tissues (MCQ)**.
4.  **Couvelaire's uterus:** In concealed hemorrhage, blood dissects into the myometrium, leading to **uterine atony and atonic postpartum hemorrhage (MCQ)**.
5.  Fetal Complications: **Fetal distress, severe IUGR, IUFD, and preterm delivery (MCQ)**.

#### **MANAGEMENT:**

Management can be active (immediate delivery) or expectant (conservative).

* **A) ACTIVE MANAGEMENT (IMMEDIATE DELIVERY):**
    * **Severe bleeding compromising maternal or fetal lives, regardless of gestational age (MCQ)**.
    * Gestational age > 36 weeks.
    * Spontaneous onset of labor.
* **B) EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT (DELAY DELIVERY):**
    * Indicated in preterm pregnancies < 36 weeks with **mild bleeding not affecting maternal or fetal well being (MCQ)** and absent labor pains. The goal is to **achieve better lung maturity (MCQ)**.
* **Route of Delivery:**
    * **Vaginal delivery is attempted in mild to moderate cases (MCQ)**.
    * **CS is indicated for severe bleeding or other obstetric indications (MCQ)**.
* **An Rh-negative mother should receive an Anti-D immunoglobulin injection (MCQ)**.

### **PLACENTA PREVIA**

Placenta previa (PL PRV) is the implantation of the placenta partially or totally on the lower uterine segment (LUS). It can lead to an **abnormally invasive placenta (AIP) (MCQ)**, especially at the site of a previous CS scar.

#### **INCIDENCE:**

* **Occurs in around 0.5% of all pregnancies (MCQ)**.
* Incidence is rising due to **increasing maternal age and repeated CS deliveries (MCQ)**.

#### **PREDISPOSING AND RISK FACTORS:**

* **Previous placenta previa (MCQ)**.
* **Previous cesarean section; risk increases with the number of previous sections (MCQ)**.
* **Increasing maternal age and parity (MCQ)**.
* **Increased placental size (e.g., in multifetal pregnancies) (MCQ)**.

#### **MECHANISM OF BLEEDING IN PL PRV:**

* **Bleeding occurs from unavoidable separation of the placenta due to stretching of the LUS (MCQ)**.

#### **PLACENTAL MIGRATION:**

* A low-lying placenta diagnosed before 24 weeks often appears to move upward as the LUS develops. **Almost 90% of these cases resolve by the third trimester (MCQ)**.

#### **CLASSIFICATION AND TYPES OF PL PRV:**

* **Grade I (Lateralis/Low-lying):** Lower edge is > 2cm from the internal os.
* **Grade II (Marginalis):** Lower edge reaches the internal os. **Considered minor placenta previa (MCQ)**.
* **Grade III (Incomplete Centralis/Partial):** Placenta partially covers the cervix.
* **Grade IV (Complete Centralis/Total):** **Placenta completely covers the cervix (MCQ)**.

#### **SYMPTOMS & SIGNS:**

* **Painless, causeless, recurrent vaginal bleeding is the most common presentation (MCQ)**.
* Severe bleeding can lead to **hypovolemic shock (MCQ)**.
* Abdominal exam: Uterus is soft and non-tender. **Malpresentations like breech and transverse lie are more frequent (MCQ)** because the placenta interferes with head engagement.
* **Vaginal Examination (PV): should not be attempted as it may provoke severe uncontrollable bleeding (MCQ)**.

#### **DIAGNOSIS:**

* **A) TRANSABDOMINAL US (TAS): This is the gold standard for diagnosis (MCQ)**.
* **B) TRANSVAGINAL US (TVS): More reliable than TAS for measuring the distance between the lower placental margin and the internal os (MCQ)**.
* C) Maternal laboratory tests.
* D) Tests for fetal wellbeing.

#### **MATERNAL AND FETAL RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS IN PL PRV:**

1.  **Severe APH leading to hypovolemic shock (MCQ)**.
2.  **Severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)** due to poor contractility of the LUS.
3.  Increased risk of CS hysterectomy.
4.  **Increased risk of abnormally invasive placenta (placenta accreta), especially with a previous CS scar (MCQ)**.
5.  Fetal complications due to prematurity, IUGR, and massive blood loss.

#### **MANAGEMENT OF PL PRV:**

* **All cases of total, partial, and marginal PL PRV will be delivered by CS (MCQ)**.
* **A) ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BY IMMEDIATE CS:**
    * **Severe bleeding compromising maternal or fetal lives, regardless of gestational age (MCQ)**.
    * Gestational age > 36 weeks.
    * Spontaneous onset of labor.
* **B) EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT TO DELAY DELIVERY:**
    * In **preterm pregnancies < 36 weeks with mild bleeding (MCQ)** and no labor pains, to allow for lung maturity. This requires hospitalization and close monitoring.
* **C) LATERAL PL PRV:**
    * A trial of vaginal delivery can be offered if the lower edge is 2 cm or more from the internal os and bleeding is minimal.

### **PLACENTA ACCRETA SPECTRUM (Abnormally Invasive Placenta)**

This is a serious condition where the placenta adheres to or invades the myometrium, occurring mostly with PL PRV due to **poor decidual reaction in the LUS, especially at a previous CS scar site (MCQ)**.

#### **TYPES OF ADHERENT PLACENTA:**

* **Accreta:** Placenta is adherent to the myometrium (most common, 80%).
* **Increta:** Placenta invades the myometrium.
* **Percreta:** Placenta perforates the myometrium, potentially invading the bladder wall.

#### **DIAGNOSIS DURING PREGNANCY:**

* Can be achieved by expert **US (2D/3D and color Doppler) (MCQ)**.
* **US reveals absence of a plane of cleavage between placenta and myometrium, with blood lacunae in cases of invasion (MCQ)**.
* MRI can also be used but offers **no significant benefit over expert US (MCQ)**.

#### **DIAGNOSIS DURING LABOR:**

* Discovered when the placenta is partially or totally retained, leading to **severe atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (MCQ)**.

#### **MANAGEMENT:**

* **The majority of cases will require CS hysterectomy as a life-saving procedure (MCQ)**.

### **RUPTURE VASA PREVIA (FETAL BLEEDING)**

A very rare condition where umbilical cord vessels cross the internal os, often associated with **velamentous insertion of the cord or a succenturiate lobe (MCQ)**. Rupture of these vessels during labor leads to **fetal bleeding, severe fetal distress, and potential intrapartum fetal death (MCQ)**. The condition requires an **emergency CS (MCQ)**.
