## Causes of bleeding in Early pregnancy
- Abortion.
- Ectopic pregnancy.
- Gestational trophoblastic disease.
- Associated gynecologic conditions (cervical erosion, polyp or cancer).

## SPONTANEOUS ABORTION (MISCARRIAGE)

### DEFINITION
- Termination of pregnancy **before viability of the fetus** (in Egypt, before 24 weeks) **(MCQ)**.

### INCIDENCE
- Occurs in **15-20% of pregnancies**, mostly in the early 1st trimester.

### ETIOLOGY
- **Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities in > 50% of cases (MCQ).**
- Accidental trauma.
- Hormonal as luteal phase defect.
- Infections e.g. **acute maternal fever**.
- Drugs: some teratogenic drugs may cause fetal demise in utero.
- Psychological factors or idiopathic.

### CLINICAL TYPES OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION
- Threatened abortion.
- Inevitable abortion.
- Incomplete abortion.
- Complete abortion.
- Missed abortion.
- Septic abortion.

### THREATENED ABORTION
#### Clinical picture
- Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.
- **Minimal vaginal bleeding (spotting) (MCQ).**
- Mild suprapubic colicky pain may be present.
- **Cervix is closed (MCQ).**
#### Investigations
- Serial quantitative βHCG estimation to detect adequate doubling.
- **Ultrasonography is the main diagnostic tool to confirm a living fetus (MCQ).**
#### Treatment
- Physical & mental rest.
- **Hormonal support e.g. natural progesterone is beneficial in cases with luteal phase defect (MCQ).**
#### Prognosis
- **50% of cases will continue pregnancy** and 50% will end in inevitable or missed abortion.

### INEVITABLE ABORTION
#### Clinical Picture
- Moderate to **severe vaginal bleeding which may cause hypovolemic shock.**
- **Rupture of membranes <24 weeks is a sign of inevitability.**
- Marked suprapubic colicky pain.
- **Cervix is usually dilated (MCQ).**
#### Treatment
- Anti-shock measures (if needed).
- Termination of pregnancy:
- **<12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation by curettage or suction (MCQ).**
- **>12 weeks:** Medical evacuation by prostaglandins. If **severe bleeding, abdominal hysterotomy (MCQ).**

### INCOMPLETE ABORTION
#### Definition
Part of the conception products are expelled from the uterus.
#### Clinical picture
- Similar bleeding and pain to inevitable abortion, with **passage of parts of conception products (MCQ).**
- **Cervix is opened & retained parts may be felt.**
#### Investigations
- **Ultrasonography detects retained products (hyper-echoic irregular tissues).**
#### Treatment
- Anti-shock measures.
- **Surgical evacuation is required to remove retained products of conception (MCQ).**

### COMPLETE ABORTION
#### Definition
All conception products are expelled from the uterus.
#### Clinical picture
**Bleeding and pain cease**, and ultrasound confirms an empty uterus **(MCQ)**.

### MISSED ABORTION
#### Definition
Death of an embryo (or fetus) occurs but is **retained in the uterus.**
#### Clinical picture
- May be symptomless, or have brownish vaginal discharge.
- Loss of pregnancy symptoms.
- Uterus is smaller than expected with a closed internal os.
- **Coagulation problems may develop (hypofibrinogenemia and DIC) if retained for several weeks (MCQ).**
#### Investigations
- **US examination is diagnostic**, revealing intrauterine fetal demise or anembryonic sac (blighted ovum).
- **Inadequate doubling or decreasing hCG levels (MCQ).**
#### Treatment
- Termination of pregnancy:
- <12 weeks: surgical evacuation.
- **>12 weeks: Medical induction by prostaglandins (MCQ).**
#### N.B
**Anti D immunoglobulin should be given to Rh-ve mothers.**

### SEPTIC ABORTION
#### Definition
Infection superimposed on any type of abortion (usually incomplete).
#### Clinical picture
- Clinical picture of abortion.
- Signs of infection: **Fever**, malaise, lower abdominal pain, **tender uterus**, and **offensive vaginal discharge.**
#### Investigations
- Blood picture shows leukocytosis.
- Blood culture, kidney/liver functions, and coagulation profile.
#### Treatment
- Hospitalization and anti-shock measures.
- **Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics.**
- Evacuation of the uterus under antibiotic cover. **High risk of uterine perforation.**
#### Complications
**Septic shock**, acute renal & liver failure, DIC.

## RECURRENT PREGNANCY LOSS (HABITUAL ABORTION)
### Definition
- **Three or more successive spontaneous abortions.**
### Causes
- **Immunologic disorders:** **Antiphospholipid syndrome (MCQ).**
- Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.
- **Local uterine causes:**
- Congenital: **septate uterus.**
- Traumatic: **Cervical incompetence (causes 2nd-trimester loss) (MCQ).**
- Neoplastic: **Submucous fibroid (MCQ).**
- General and chronic diseases (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes).
- Hormonal: luteal phase defect, thyroid dysfunction.
### Diagnosis
- **History:** Late 1st and 2nd trimester abortions may suggest anti-phospholipid syndrome or cervical incompetence.
- **Investigations:** Vaginal ultrasound, hysteroscopy, chromosomal karyotyping for the couple, screening for **antiphospholipid syndrome (Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies) (MCQ)** and thrombophilia.
### Treatment
- **During pregnancy:**
- Progesterone supplementation for luteal phase defect.
- **Low dose aspirin and Low molecular weight Heparin for antiphospholipid syndrome (MCQ).**
- Surgical treatment: for incompetent os (cerclage).

## Cervical (Isthmic) Incompetence
### Definition
- Inability of the cervix to retain conception past the 1st trimester.
### Etiology
- Traumatic injury (e.g., forcible D&C, cervical lacerations).
- Congenital (rare).
### Diagnosis
- History of **mid-trimester abortions with minimal pain and bleeding, often preceded by ROM (MCQ).**
- **Ultrasound:** **short cervix <2.5cm with funneling of membranes (MCQ).**
### Treatment
- **Cervical cerclage operation** during pregnancy ( elective at 11-14 weeks).
- Suture is removed at 37 weeks or at the onset of labor.

## ECTOPIC PREGNANCY
### Definition
- Implantation of the fertilized ovum **outside the normal uterine cavity.**
### Sites
- **Fallopian tube (most common, >95%):** Ampullary portion is the most common site. Early disturbance occurs in the **isthmic portion (MCQ)**.
- Other sites: Ovary, abdomen, rudimentary horn, cervix, CS scar.

## TUBAL ECTOPIC
### Etiology and Risk factors
- **Previous ectopic gestation (highest risk) (MCQ).**
- **Previous Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).**
- Endometriosis.
- Pelvic and tubal surgery.
- **IUD (prevents intrauterine, not extra-uterine pregnancy) (MCQ).**
- Progesterone effect (e.g., progesterone-only contraception).
- ICSI procedure.
### Results of tubal ectopic
- **Tubal mole:** Dead ovum surrounded by a blood clot.
- **Tubal abortion:** Ovum passes through the abdominal ostium, may cause hematosalpinx or pelvic hematocele **(MCQ)**.
- **Tubal rupture:** Results in diffuse intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
### Clinical Picture
#### Symptoms
- Short period of amenorrhea.
- **Pain is the most prominent symptom (MCQ).** It precedes bleeding.
- **Shoulder pain** occurs with massive internal hemorrhage due to phrenic nerve irritation.
- Vaginal bleeding is usually slight and dark.
- Syncope (fainting attacks).
#### Signs
- Signs of internal bleeding/shock (rapid pulse, hypotension).
- Lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness.
- **Marked tenderness on moving the cervix.**
- An adnexal mass may be felt.
### Specific investigations
- **Combined TVS and serum β-hCG are the main diagnostic tools (MCQ).**
- **TVS:** **Empty uterus** with an adnexal mass and/or pelvic fluid.
- **Serum βhCG level:**
- **Improper doubling (not increasing by at least 60% every 48 hours) suggests an unhealthy or ectopic pregnancy (MCQ).**
- **Discrimination zone:** A gestational sac should be seen intrauterine by TVS with a β-HCG level of **1500 IU/mL**. If the uterus is empty at this level, it confirms an ectopic pregnancy **(MCQ).**
- **Laparoscopy:** Can confirm diagnosis in doubtful, hemodynamically stable cases.
### Management of tubal pregnancy
#### Surgical treatment
- **Conservative (Salpingostomy):** For young patients with an unruptured tube to preserve fertility.
- **Radical (Salpingectomy):** Removal of the tube, often done for ruptured or severely damaged tubes **(MCQ).**
#### Medical treatment (Methotrexate)
- **Indications:** Undisturbed early cases, small ectopic < 3cm, **no fetal cardiac activity**, and hCG <6000 mIU/ml **(MCQ).**
- **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, **fetal heart motion**, history of active hepatic or renal disease **(MCQ).**
- **Counseling:** Subsequent pregnancy should be delayed for 3 months **(MCQ).**

## Other Types of Ectopic Pregnancy
- **Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy:** Presents with **severe vaginal bleeding** rather than pain **(MCQ).**
- **CS Scar Pregnancy:** Increasing in frequency. **Curettage is a poor treatment option due to high risk of perforation (MCQ).**
- **Pregnancy in a Rudimentary Horn:** Ruptures later (4th-5th month) with marked internal hemorrhage **(MCQ).**

## GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE (GTD)

### VESICULAR (HYDATIDIFORM) MOLE
#### Risk factors
Extremes of age (<20 & >35 years).
#### Pathology
- **Complete mole:** Fertilization of an empty ovum. **Karyotype is 46,XX (paternal origin) (MCQ)**. No fetal tissue. Diffuse trophoblastic proliferation.
- **Partial mole:** Fertilization of a normal ovum by 2 sperms. **Karyotype is triploidy (69 chromosomes).** Fetal tissues are present. Focal changes. **Low potential for malignant transformation (MCQ).**
- **Theca lutein cysts:** Occur in 25-60% of complete moles due to high hCG levels. **They regress spontaneously after molar evacuation (MCQ).**
#### Clinical picture
- Recurrent early pregnancy bleeding.
- **Severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum).**
- Uterus is **larger than calculated gestational age** and has a soft, doughy consistency.
#### Diagnostic investigations
- **Ultrasonography is the gold standard.**
- Complete mole: **Characteristic "snowstorm" appearance (MCQ).**
- **Serum β-hCG:** **Abnormally high levels (>100,000 mIU/ml).**
#### Complications
- Severe bleeding, **early onset preeclampsia**, hyperthyroidism, trophoblastic embolization.
- **Risk of developing an invasive Mole or Choriocarcinoma (5% of cases) (MCQ).**
#### Management
- **Suction evacuation is the gold standard technique (MCQ).**
- **Hysterectomy** can be considered for elderly patients (>40 years) with completed family **(MCQ).**
#### Follow up
- **Serial serum β-hCG assays are mandatory** weekly until negative, then monthly for 1 year to detect **persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD) (MCQ).**
- **Effective contraception for 1 year is essential.**

### Malignant Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)
#### Description
- Includes **Invasive mole** and **Choriocarcinoma.**
- Characterized by aggressive invasion and tendency to metastasize (lungs, vagina, brain, liver).
- **More than 50% follow a molar pregnancy.** Can also occur after abortion or term pregnancy.
#### Diagnosis
- **Persistent vaginal bleeding** and **abnormally high hCG levels** after a pregnancy event.
#### Management
- **Chemotherapy is the main line of treatment.** Hysterectomy may be offered in select cases.
