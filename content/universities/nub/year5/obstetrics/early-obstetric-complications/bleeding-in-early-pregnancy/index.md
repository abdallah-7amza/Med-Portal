title: "Bleeding in Early Pregnancy"

### Causes of bleeding in Early pregnancy:
* **Abortion.**
* **Ectopic pregnancy.**
* **Gestational trophoblastic disease.**
* Associated gynecologic conditions (cervical erosion, polyp or cancer).

### SPONTANEOUS ABORTION (MISCARRIAGE)
**DEFINITION:**
Termination of pregnancy **before viability of the fetus (in Egypt, before 24 weeks) (MCQ)**. Viability denotes the chance of survival with maximum pediatric support.

**INCIDENCE:**
Occurs in **15-20%** of pregnancies, mostly in the early 1st trimester.

**ETIOLOGY:**
* **Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities in > 50% of cases (MCQ).**
* Accidental trauma.
* Hormonal as luteal phase defect.
* Infections e.g. acute maternal fever.
* Drugs: some teratogenic drugs may cause fetal demise.
* Psychological factors or idiopathic.

**CLINICAL TYPES OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION:**
* Threatened abortion.
* Inevitable abortion.
* Incomplete abortion.
* Complete abortion.
* Missed abortion.
* Septic abortion.

---
### THREATENED ABORTION
**Clinical picture:**
* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.
* Minimal vaginal bleeding.
* Mild suprapubic colicky pain may be present.
* **Cervix is closed (MCQ).**
* **Ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac with a living fetus (MCQ).**

**Investigations:**
* Serial quantitative ẞHCG estimation to detect adequate doubling.
* **Ultrasonography is the main diagnostic tool** to confirm fetal condition.

**Treatment:**
* Physical & mental rest.
* **Hormonal support e.g. natural progesterone is beneficial in cases with luteal phase defect (MCQ).**
* Follow up to ensure clinical improvement and fetal growth.

**Prognosis:**
**50% of cases will continue pregnancy** and 50% will end in inevitable or missed abortion.

---
### INEVITABLE ABORTION
There is no chance for pregnancy to continue.

**Clinical Picture:**
* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.
* **Moderate to severe vaginal bleeding** which may cause hypovolemic shock.
* **Rupture of membranes <24 weeks is a sign of inevitability.**
* Marked suprapubic colicky pain.
* **PV examination reveals a dilated cervix (MCQ).**

**Investigations:**
* Ultrasonography to detect gestational age and decide the route of termination.
* Blood group and CBC.

**Treatment:**
Anti-shock measures and termination of pregnancy:
* **Anti-shock measures:** Rest, sedation, I.V crystalloids infusion, and blood transfusion if needed.
* **Termination of pregnancy:**
    * **<12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation by curettage or suction (MCQ).**
    * **>12 weeks:** Medical evacuation by prostaglandins. If bleeding is severe, **abdominal hysterotomy is performed (MCQ).**

---
### INCOMPLETE ABORTION
Part of the conception products are expelled from the uterus.

**Clinical picture:**
* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.
* Bleeding & pain similar to inevitable abortion, with **passage of parts of conception products (MCQ).**
* **PV examination reveals an opened cervix with retained parts (MCQ).**

**Investigations:**
* **Ultrasonography detects retained products of conception (POC) (MCQ).**

**Treatment:**
* Anti-shock measures.
* **Surgical evacuation.**

---
### COMPLETE ABORTION
All conception products are expelled from the uterus. **Bleeding and pain cease, and ultrasound confirms an empty uterus (MCQ).**

---
### MISSED ABORTION
Death of an embryo or fetus that is retained in the uterus.

**Clinical picture:**
* May be symptomless initially, later a **brownish vaginal discharge (MCQ)** and recurrent bleeding may occur, with loss of pregnancy symptoms.
* PV examination reveals a smaller-than-expected uterus with a **closed internal os**.
* **Coagulation problems like hypofibrinogenaemia and DIC may develop if retained for several weeks (MCQ).**

**Investigations:**
* **US examination is diagnostic**, revealing intrauterine fetal demise or anembryonic sac (blighted ovum).
* Inadequate doubling or decreasing hCG levels.

**Treatment:**
Termination of pregnancy:
* <12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation.
* **>12 weeks: Medical induction by prostaglandins (MCQ).** Oxytocin is not effective due to decreased receptors. Abdominal hysterotomy is rare.
* **N.B:** Following abortion, **Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to RH-ve mothers.**

---
### SEPTIC ABORTION
Infection superimposed on any type of abortion, usually incomplete.

**Routes of infection:**
* Exogenous: from instruments.
* Endogenous: from genital tract flora.
* Autogenous: from a septic focus in the body.

**Clinical picture:**
* Clinical picture of abortion.
* Clinical picture of infection:
    * **Generally:** Fever, headache, malaise, or septic shock.
    * **Locally:** Lower abdominal pain, tender uterus, and **offensive vaginal discharge.**

**Investigations:**
* U.S. to detect intrauterine contents.
* Blood picture shows leukocytosis.
* Blood culture, kidney/liver functions, and coagulation profile.
* Vaginal/cervical swab culture has limited value.

**Treatment:**
* Isolate the patient, Fowler's position.
* Antishock measures may be needed.
* **Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics.**
* **Obstetrical management:**
    * < 12 weeks: Vaginal surgical evacuation under antibiotic cover.
    * >12 weeks: Medical induction. Hysterotomy or hysterectomy may be done if failed or uterus is markedly infected.

**Complications:**
* **Septic shock.**
* **Acute renal & liver failure.**
* **DIC.**

### RECURRENT PREGNANCY LOSS (HABITUAL ABORTION)
**Definition:** **Three or more successive spontaneous abortions.**

**Incidence:** 1-2%

**Causes:**
* **Immunologic disorders are the commonest cause of early RPL:** **Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)** leads to thrombosis of placental vessels.
* Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities of the fertilized ovum.
* Local causes in the uterus:
    * Congenital: septate uterus.
    * Traumatic: **Cervical incompetence (2nd trimesteric) (MCQ).**
    * Neoplastic: **Submucous fibroid, especially fundal (MCQ).**
* General and chronic diseases.
* Hormonal as luteal phase defect or thyroid dysfunction.
* Drugs or excessive smoking.
* Chronic severe psychological disorders.
* **N.B.: A fundal subserous fibroid does not commonly cause recurrent abortion (MCQ).**

**Diagnosis:**
* **History:** Early abortions suggest genetic causes or luteal phase defect. **Late 1st and 2nd trimester abortions may suggest antiphospholipid syndrome or cervical incompetence (MCQ).**
* **Examination:** May detect general disease or local uterine causes.
* **Investigations:**
    * **Vaginal ultrasound** to detect uterine anomalies, fibroids, or signs of an incompetent cervix.
    * Hysteroscopy for endometrial cavity evaluation.
    * Chromosomal karyotyping for the couple.
    * Thyroid function, blood sugar, etc.
    * **Screening for anti-phospholipid syndrome: Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and ß2 glycoprotein (MCQ).**
    * Screening for other causes of thrombophilia (Protein-S, Protein-C deficiency).

**Treatment:**
* **Inbetween pregnancies:** Treat the cause (e.g., myomectomy), control general disease.
* **During pregnancy:**
    * Progesterone supplementation for luteal phase defect.
    * **Low dose aspirin (LDA) and Low molecular weight Heparin for antiphospholipid syndrome (MCQ).**
    * Surgical treatment for incompetent os.

### Cervical (Isthmic) Incompetence
**Definition:** Inability of the cervix to retain conception past the 1st trimester.

**Etiology:**
* **Traumatic injury** from D&C, previous delivery, or cervical surgery.
* **Congenital:** very rare.

**Diagnosis:**
* Past history of trauma.
* **Abortions are usually mid-trimesteric, easy, preceded by R.O.M & associated with minimal pain & bleeding (MCQ).**
* Aborted fetus appears normal.
* **During pregnancy: Ultrasound reveals funneling of membranes and a short cervix <2.5cm (MCQ).**

**Treatment:**
* **Cerclage operation** during pregnancy at 11-14 weeks, with rest and tocolytics. The suture is removed at 37 weeks or at the onset of labor.

---
### ECTOPIC PREGNANCY
**Definition:** Implantation of the fertilized ovum outside the normal uterine cavity.

**Incidence:** 0.5-2% of all pregnancies.

**Sites:**
* **Fallopian tube is the most common site (MCQ)**, mostly in the ampulla.
* Other sites: Ovary, abdomen, rudimentary horn, cervix, CS scar.

### TUBAL ECTOPIC
**Etiology and Risk factors:**
* **Previous ectopic gestation (MCQ).**
* Previous Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).
* Endometriosis.
* Pelvic and tubal surgery.
* **IUD: prevents intrauterine pregnancy but not extra-uterine (MCQ).**
* **Progesterone effect (e.g., in progesterone-only contraception) (MCQ).**
* **ICSI procedure.**
* **N.B.: Previous cesarean section is not a primary risk factor for tubal ectopic pregnancy (MCQ).**

**Pathology:**
* **Uterus:** Slightly enlarged with decidua present without chorionic villi (Arias-Stella reaction).
* **Tube:** Disturbance of pregnancy occurs as early as 8-10 weeks.
* **Results:** Tubal mole, tubal abortion, or tubal rupture.

**Clinical Picture:**
* **[I] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, subacute type (stable):**
    * **Symptoms:**
        * Short period of amenorrhea.
        * **Pain is the most prominent symptom (MCQ). It may be aching, stabbing, or colicky. It precedes vaginal bleeding (MCQ).**
        * **Shoulder pain occurs in massive internal hemorrhage (MCQ).**
        * **Vaginal bleeding is usually slight and dark (MCQ).**
        * Syncope, nausea, and vomiting.
    * **Signs:**
        * **General:** Rapid pulse, falling BP proportional to internal bleeding.
        * **Abdominal:** Lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness.
        * **Vaginal:** Marked tenderness on moving the cervix. Uterus slightly enlarged, adnexal mass may be felt.
* **[II] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, acute type (unstable):**
    * The patient is shocked with severe intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. **It is an emergency.**
* **[III] Undisturbed tubal pregnancy:**
    * No symptoms or mild pelvic pain. Discovered accidentally.

**Specific investigations:**
* **The most important are combined transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and estimation of ß-hCG (MCQ).**
* **TVS:** **Diagnostic findings are an empty uterus with an adnexal mass** and pelvic fluid collection.
* **Serum ßhCG level:** In ectopic pregnancy, there is an **improper doubling of the level after 48 hours (MCQ).**
* **Discrimination zone:** With a ß-HCG level of **>1500 IU/mL, a gestational sac should be seen intrauterine by TVS (MCQ).** If the uterus is empty, it confirms an ectopic pregnancy.
* **Laparoscopy:** Used to confirm the diagnosis in doubtful, hemodynamically stable cases.

**Management of tubal pregnancy:**
* Blood transfusion and antishock measures may be needed.
* **Anti-D should be given to RH-ve cases.**
* **(A) Surgical treatment:**
    * **Conservative:** Salpingostomy (linear incision to remove ectopic), tube heals by secondary intention. Recurrence rate is high.
    * **Radical:** Unilateral salpingectomy.
* **(B) Medical treatment by methotrexate injections:**
    * **Mode of action:** Antifolinic acid.
    * **Indications:** Undisturbed early cases with ectopic < 3cm, **no fetal heart activity (MCQ)**, and hCG <6000 mIU/ml.
    * Contraindications: **History of active hepatic or renal disease (MCQ).**
    * Regimen: Single IM injection. Follow up with serum ß-HCG.
    * Counseling: **Subsequent pregnancy should be delayed for 3 months (MCQ).**

### Other Types of Ectopic Pregnancy
* **Ovarian Ectopic Pregnancy:** Similar symptoms to tubal. Treatment aims to preserve ovarian tissue.
* **Advanced Abdominal Pregnancy:** Rare. Placenta is often left in situ to avoid massive hemorrhage.
* **Pregnancy in a Rudimentary Horn:** **Ruptures late, around 4th-5th month (MCQ).**
* **Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy:** **Presents with severe vaginal bleeding rather than pain (MCQ).** Hysterectomy may be needed for life-threatening bleeding.
* **CS Scar Pregnancy:** Increasing frequency. Can be treated with methotrexate or surgery. **Curettage is not a good option (MCQ).**

### GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE (GTD)
A spectrum of cellular proliferations from placental trophoblasts.
* **Benign GTD:** Vesicular (Hydatidiform) Mole (Complete and Partial).
* **Malignant GTD:** Invasive Mole and **Choriocarcinoma (MCQ).**

### VESICULAR (HYDATIDIFORM) MOLE
Rare, benign form of GTD.

**Risk factors:** **Extremes of age (<20 & >35 years).**

**Pathology:**
* **A. Complete mole:**
    * Originates from **fertilization of an empty ovum, resulting in a 46 XX karyotype (MCQ).**
    * **Gross:** Uterine cavity distended with grape-like vesicles. **No amniotic sac or fetal tissue.**
    * **Histology:** Diffuse trophoblastic proliferation, marked villous edema, absent fetal blood vessels.
* **B. Partial mole:**
    * Originates from fertilization of a normal ovum by 2 sperms, leading to **triploidy (69 chromosomes).**
    * **Gross:** Focal hydatidiform changes, with presence of amniotic sac or fetal tissues.
    * **Histology:** Focal villous edema and trophoblastic proliferation.
* **C. Associated ovarian cysts:**
    * **Functional ovarian theca lutein cysts occur in 25-60% of complete moles** due to high hCG levels.
    * **They undergo spontaneous regression after molar evacuation (MCQ).**

**Clinical picture of molar pregnancy:**
* **Recurrent early pregnancy bleeding is the chief symptom.**
* **Severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) due to high hCG levels.**
* Characteristic prune juice discharge or expulsion of vesicles.
* **Fundal level larger than gestational age.**
* Uterus is soft and **doughy.**
* Fetal parts and heart pulsations are absent in complete moles.

**Diagnostic investigations:**
* **Ultrasonography is the gold standard.**
    * **Complete mole: shows a characteristic "snowstorm" appearance (MCQ).**
    * Partial Mole: shows an embryo, often with anomalies, and vesicular changes in the placenta.
* **Serum ß-hCG: Abnormally high levels, often >100,000 mIU/ml (MCQ).**
* Metastatic workup for malignant changes.

**Complications of molar pregnancy:**
* **Hyperemesis gravidarum.**
* Severe bleeding.
* **Early onset pregnancy induced hypertension.**
* **Hyperthyroidism.**
* Trophoblastic embolization.
* Risk of developing Invasive Mole or **Choriocarcinoma (5% of complete moles) (MCQ).**
* **Subsequent uterine adenocarcinoma is not a complication (MCQ).**

**Management of molar pregnancy:**
* **Suction evacuation is the gold standard technique (MCQ).**
* Gentle curettage is performed after suction to ensure complete evacuation.
* **Hysterectomy is indicated only in elderly patients (>40 years) with a completed family (MCQ).**
* **Follow up:**
    * **Repeated serum ß-hCG assays weekly until negative for 3 weeks, then monthly for 1 year (MCQ).**
    * **Contraception is recommended for 1 year.**
* **Persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD):** Incomplete fall of hCG levels after evacuation. Treated with methotrexate.

### Malignant Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)
Includes Invasive Mole and Choriocarcinoma.
* **More than 50% follow a molar pregnancy.**
* Characterized by aggressive invasion and tendency to metastasize (lung, vagina, brain, liver).
* **Gestational Choriocarcinoma:** A highly malignant tumor with early blood-borne metastases.

**Diagnosis of Malignant GTD:**
* **Persistent vaginal bleeding** following a pregnancy event.
* **Abnormally high or rising hCG levels** after a terminated pregnancy.
* Imaging (TVS/TAS, MRI, CT) to detect uterine lesion and metastases.

**Management:**
* **Chemotherapy is the main line of treatment.**
* Hysterectomy may be offered to elderly patients or in cases with severe bleeding.
