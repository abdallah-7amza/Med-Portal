Viability denotes the chance of survival with maximum pediatric support.\n\n**INCIDENCE:**\nOccurs in **15-20%** of pregnancies, mostly in the early 1st trimester.\n\n**ETIOLOGY:**\n* **Genetic or chromosomal abnormalities in > 50% of cases (MCQ).**\n* Accidental trauma.\n* Hormonal as luteal phase defect.\n* Infections e.g. acute maternal fever.\n* Drugs: some teratogenic drugs may cause fetal demise.\n* Psychological factors or idiopathic.\n\n**CLINICAL TYPES OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION:**\n* Threatened abortion.\n* Inevitable abortion.\n* Incomplete abortion.\n* Complete abortion.\n* Missed abortion.\n* Septic abortion.\n\n---\n### THREATENED ABORTION\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* Minimal vaginal bleeding.\n* Mild suprapubic colicky pain may be present.\n* **Cervix is closed (MCQ).**\n* **Ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac with a living fetus (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* Serial quantitative ẞHCG estimation to detect adequate doubling.\n* **Ultrasonography is the main diagnostic tool** to confirm fetal condition.\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Physical & mental rest.\n* **Hormonal support e.g. natural progesterone is beneficial in cases with luteal phase defect (MCQ).**\n* Follow up to ensure clinical improvement and fetal growth.\n\n**Prognosis:**\n**50% of cases will continue pregnancy** and 50% will end in inevitable or missed abortion.\n\n---\n### INEVITABLE ABORTION\nThere is no chance for pregnancy to continue.\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* **Moderate to severe vaginal bleeding** which may cause hypovolemic shock.\n* **Rupture of membranes <24 weeks is a sign of inevitability.**\n* Marked suprapubic colicky pain.\n* **PV examination reveals a dilated cervix (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* Ultrasonography to detect gestational age and decide the route of termination.\n* Blood group and CBC.\n\n**Treatment:**\nAnti-shock measures and termination of pregnancy:\n* **Anti-shock measures:** Rest, sedation, I.V crystalloids infusion, and blood transfusion if needed.\n* **Termination of pregnancy:**\n    * **<12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation by curettage or suction (MCQ).**\n    * **>12 weeks:** Medical evacuation by prostaglandins. If bleeding is severe, **abdominal hysterotomy is performed (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### INCOMPLETE ABORTION\nPart of the conception products are expelled from the uterus.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Symptoms & signs of pregnancy are present.\n* Bleeding & pain similar to inevitable abortion, with **passage of parts of conception products (MCQ).**\n* **PV examination reveals an opened cervix with retained parts (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* **Ultrasonography detects retained products of conception (POC) (MCQ).**\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Anti-shock measures.\n* **Surgical evacuation.**\n\n---\n### COMPLETE ABORTION\nAll conception products are expelled from the uterus. **Bleeding and pain cease, and ultrasound confirms an empty uterus (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### MISSED ABORTION\nDeath of an embryo or fetus that is retained in the uterus.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* May be symptomless initially, later a **brownish vaginal discharge (MCQ)** and recurrent bleeding may occur, with loss of pregnancy symptoms.\n* PV examination reveals a smaller-than-expected uterus with a **closed internal os**.\n* **Coagulation problems like hypofibrinogenaemia and DIC may develop if retained for several weeks (MCQ).**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* **US examination is diagnostic**, revealing intrauterine fetal demise or anembryonic sac (blighted ovum).\n* Inadequate doubling or decreasing hCG levels.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTermination of pregnancy:\n* <12 weeks: surgical vaginal evacuation.\n* **>12 weeks: Medical induction by prostaglandins (MCQ).** Oxytocin is not effective due to decreased receptors. Abdominal hysterotomy is rare.\n* **N.B:** Following abortion, **Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to RH-ve mothers.**\n\n---\n### SEPTIC ABORTION\nInfection superimposed on any type of abortion, usually incomplete.\n\n**Routes of infection:**\n* Exogenous: from instruments.\n* Endogenous: from genital tract flora.\n* Autogenous: from a septic focus in the body.\n\n**Clinical picture:**\n* Clinical picture of abortion.\n* Clinical picture of infection:\n    * **Generally:** Fever, headache, malaise, or septic shock.\n    * **Locally:** Lower abdominal pain, tender uterus, and **offensive vaginal discharge.**\n\n**Investigations:**\n* U.S. to detect intrauterine contents.\n* Blood picture shows leukocytosis.\n* Blood culture, kidney/liver functions, and coagulation profile.\n* Vaginal/cervical swab culture has limited value.\n\n**Treatment:**\n* Isolate the patient, Fowler's position.\n* Antishock measures may be needed.\n* **Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics.**\n* **Obstetrical management:**\n    * < 12 weeks: Vaginal surgical evacuation under antibiotic cover.\n    * >12 weeks: Medical induction. Hysterotomy or hysterectomy may be done if failed or uterus is markedly infected.\n\n**Complications:**\n* **Septic shock.**\n* **Acute renal & liver failure.**\n* **DIC.**\n\n---\n### SUMMARY OF CLINICAL TYPES OF ABORTION\n| | **Threatened Ab.** | **Missed** | **Inevitable** | **Incomplete** | **complete** | **septic** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Symptoms** | | | | | | |\n| 1-Bleeding | -ve | -ve | +ve | +ve | -ve | +ve |\n| 2-cramping Pelvic pain | Usually mild + | Usually mild + | ++or+++ | ++or+++ | + or -ve | Foul vag. discharge Fever |\n| **General exam.** | | | | | | |\n| Bp | Normotensive | Normotensive | Hypotension May be shocked | Hypotension May be shocked | Normotensive | Normotensive |\n| Pulse (rate and volume) | Average | Average | Rapid & low volume | Rapid & low volume | Average | Fever Rapid+good volume |\n| **Pelvic exam.** | | | | | | |\n| 1-Bleeding | Mild + | Mild + | Moderate/severe | Moderate/severe | Mild + | -ve or +ve |\n| 2-Int.

The suture is removed at 37 weeks or at the onset of labor.\n\n---\n### ECTOPIC PREGNANCY\n**Definition:** Implantation of the fertilized ovum outside the normal uterine cavity.\n\n**Incidence:** 0.5-2% of all pregnancies.\n\n**Sites:**\n* **Fallopian tube is the most common site (MCQ)**, mostly in the ampulla.\n* Other sites: Ovary, abdomen, rudimentary horn, cervix, CS scar.\n\n### TUBAL ECTOPIC\n**Etiology and Risk factors:**\n* **Previous ectopic gestation (MCQ).**\n* Previous Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).\n* Endometriosis.\n* Pelvic and tubal surgery.\n* **IUD: prevents intrauterine pregnancy but not extra-uterine (MCQ).**\n* **Progesterone effect (e.g., in progesterone-only contraception) (MCQ).**\n* **ICSI procedure.**\n* **N.B.: Previous cesarean section is not a primary risk factor for tubal ectopic pregnancy (MCQ).**\n\n**Pathology:**\n* **Uterus:** Slightly enlarged with decidua present without chorionic villi (Arias-Stella reaction).\n* **Tube:** Disturbance of pregnancy occurs as early as 8-10 weeks.\n* **Results:** Tubal mole, tubal abortion, or tubal rupture.\n\n**Clinical Picture:**\n* **[I] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, subacute type (stable):**\n    * **Symptoms:**\n        * Short period of amenorrhea.\n        * **Pain is the most prominent symptom (MCQ). It may be aching, stabbing, or colicky. It precedes vaginal bleeding (MCQ).**\n        * **Shoulder pain occurs in massive internal hemorrhage (MCQ).**\n        * **Vaginal bleeding is usually slight and dark (MCQ).**\n        * Syncope, nausea, and vomiting.\n    * **Signs:**\n        * **General:** Rapid pulse, falling BP proportional to internal bleeding.\n        * **Abdominal:** Lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness.\n        * **Vaginal:** Marked tenderness on moving the cervix. Uterus slightly enlarged, adnexal mass may be felt.\n* **[II] Disturbed ectopic pregnancy, acute type (unstable):**\n    * The patient is shocked with severe intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. **It is an emergency.**\n* **[III] Undisturbed tubal pregnancy:**\n    * No symptoms or mild pelvic pain. Discovered accidentally.\n\n**Specific investigations:**\n* **The most important are combined transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and estimation of ß-hCG (MCQ).**\n* **TVS:** **Diagnostic findings are an empty uterus with an adnexal mass** and pelvic fluid collection.\n* **Serum ßhCG level:** In ectopic pregnancy, there is an **improper doubling of the level after 48 hours (MCQ).**\n* **Discrimination zone:** With a ß-HCG level of **>1500 IU/mL, a gestational sac should be seen intrauterine by TVS (MCQ).** If the uterus is empty, it confirms an ectopic pregnancy.\n* **Laparoscopy:** Used to confirm the diagnosis in doubtful, hemodynamically stable cases.\n\n**Management of tubal pregnancy:**\n* Blood transfusion and antishock measures may be needed.\n* **Anti-D should be given to RH-ve cases.**\n* **(A) Surgical treatment:**\n    * **Conservative:** Salpingostomy (linear incision to remove ectopic), tube heals by secondary intention. Recurrence rate is high.\n    * **Radical:** Unilateral salpingectomy.\n* **(B) Medical treatment by methotrexate injections:**\n    * **Mode of action:** Antifolinic acid.\n    * **Indications:** Undisturbed early cases with ectopic < 3cm, **no fetal heart activity (MCQ)**, and hCG <6000 mIU/ml.\n    * Contraindications: **History of active hepatic or renal disease (MCQ).**\n    * Regimen: Single IM injection. Follow up with serum ß-HCG.\n    * Counseling: **Subsequent pregnancy should be delayed for 3 months (MCQ).**\n\n### Other Types of Ectopic Pregnancy\n* **Ovarian Ectopic Pregnancy:** Similar symptoms to tubal. Treatment aims to preserve ovarian tissue.\n* **Advanced Abdominal Pregnancy:** Rare. Placenta is often left in situ to avoid massive hemorrhage.\n* **Pregnancy in a Rudimentary Horn:** **Ruptures late, around 4th-5th month (MCQ).**\n* **Cervical Ectopic Pregnancy:** **Presents with severe vaginal bleeding rather than pain (MCQ).** Hysterectomy may be needed for life-threatening bleeding.\n* **CS Scar Pregnancy:** Increasing frequency. Can be treated with methotrexate or surgery. **Curettage is not a good option (MCQ).**\n\n---\n### GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE (GTD)\nA spectrum of cellular proliferations from placental trophoblasts.\n* **Benign GTD:** Vesicular (Hydatidiform) Mole (Complete and Partial).\n* **Malignant GTD:** Invasive Mole and **Choriocarcinoma (MCQ).**\n\n### VESICULAR (HYDATIDIFORM) MOLE\nRare, benign form of GTD.\n\n**Risk factors:** **Extremes of age (<20 & >35 years).**\n\n**Pathology:**\n* **A. Complete mole:**\n    * Originates from **fertilization of an empty ovum, resulting in a 46 XX karyotype (MCQ).**\n    * **Gross:** Uterine cavity distended with grape-like vesicles. **No amniotic sac or fetal tissue.**\n    * **Histology:** Diffuse trophoblastic proliferation, marked villous edema, absent fetal blood vessels.\n* **B. Partial mole:**\n    * Originates from fertilization of a normal ovum by 2 sperms, leading to **triploidy (69 chromosomes).**\n    * **Gross:** Focal hydatidiform changes, with presence of amniotic sac or fetal tissues.\n    * **Histology:** Focal villous edema and trophoblastic proliferation.\n* **C. Associated ovarian cysts:**\n    * **Functional ovarian theca lutein cysts occur in 25-60% of complete moles** due to high hCG levels.\n    * **They undergo spontaneous regression after molar evacuation (MCQ).**\n\n**Clinical picture of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Recurrent early pregnancy bleeding is the chief symptom.**\n* **Severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum) due to high hCG levels.**\n* Characteristic prune juice discharge or expulsion of vesicles.\n* **Fundal level larger than gestational age.**\n* Uterus is soft and **doughy.**\n* Fetal parts and heart pulsations are absent in complete moles.\n\n**Diagnostic investigations:**\n* **Ultrasonography is the gold standard.**\n    * **Complete mole: shows a characteristic \"snowstorm\" appearance (MCQ).**\n    * Partial Mole: shows an embryo, often with anomalies, and vesicular changes in the placenta.\n* **Serum ß-hCG: Abnormally high levels, often >100,000 mIU/ml (MCQ).**\n* Metastatic workup for malignant changes.\n\n**Complications of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Hyperemesis gravidarum.**\n* Severe bleeding.\n* **Early onset pregnancy induced hypertension.**\n* **Hyperthyroidism.**\n* Trophoblastic embolization.\n* Risk of developing Invasive Mole or **Choriocarcinoma (5% of complete moles) (MCQ).**\n* **Subsequent uterine adenocarcinoma is not a complication (MCQ).**\n\n**Management of molar pregnancy:**\n* **Suction evacuation is the gold standard technique (MCQ).**\n* Gentle curettage is performed after suction to ensure complete evacuation.\n* **Hysterectomy is indicated only in elderly patients (>40 years) with a completed family (MCQ).**\n* **Follow up:**\n    * **Repeated serum ß-hCG assays weekly until negative for 3 weeks, then monthly for 1 year (MCQ).**\n    * **Contraception is recommended for 1 year.**\n* **Persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD):** Incomplete fall of hCG levels after evacuation. Treated with methotrexate.\n\n### Malignant Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD)\nIncludes Invasive Mole and Choriocarcinoma.\n* **More than 50% follow a molar pregnancy.**\n* Characterized by aggressive invasion and tendency to metastasize (lung, vagina, brain, liver).\n* **Gestational Choriocarcinoma:** A highly malignant tumor with early blood-borne metastases.\n\n**Diagnosis of Malignant GTD:**\n* **Persistent vaginal bleeding** following a pregnancy event.\n* **Abnormally high or rising hCG levels** after a terminated pregnancy.\n* Imaging (TVS/TAS, MRI, CT) to detect uterine lesion and metastases.\n\n**Management:**\n* **Chemotherapy is the main line of treatment.**\n* Hysterectomy may be offered to elderly patients or in cases with severe bleeding.\n",
