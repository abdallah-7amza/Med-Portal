        "Amniotic fluid volume assessment."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Biophysical Profile (BPP) is an ultrasound evaluation that assesses fetal tone, fetal movements, fetal breathing activities, and amniotic fluid volume. Placental grading is not a component of the BPP."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Non-Stress Test (NST) directly assesses fetal oxygenation and neurological function based on heart rate reactivity, which is a critical indicator of fetal well-being in the context of a BPP assessment."

        "Fetal lung distension.",
        "Fetal electrolyte balance."
      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Amniotic fluid protects the fetus from trauma, maintains temperature, serves as an excretory medium, and allows for lung development. It does not directly regulate fetal electrolyte balance."

        "Twins"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "While maternal diabetes is a common cause, most cases of polyhydramnios are ultimately considered idiopathic, resulting from an imbalance between fluid production and absorption."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Anencephaly is a fetal congenital anomaly explicitly associated with polyhydramnios, often due to impaired fetal swallowing. In contrast, renal agenesis is associated with oligohydramnios."

        "Meningeo-encephalocele."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Congenital polycystic kidneys fall under the category of renal anomalies that impair fetal urine production, which is the primary source of amniotic fluid, thus leading to oligohydramnios."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Caput succedaneum is characterized by ill-defined edema that crosses suture lines, thus overlying more than one cranial bone. It appears at birth and resolves without treatment."

      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "A large caput succedaneum may give a false impression of head engagement, where the scalp is felt low in the vagina while the skull is still at a higher, non-engaged level."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) levels are abnormally decreased in cases with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Conversely, levels are increased in open neural tube defects like anencephaly."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Symmetric FGR usually results from an issue intrinsic to the fetus that occurs early in development, such as intrauterine infections, chromosomal abnormalities, or other congenital malformations."

      "options": [

        "In symmetric type; oligohydramnios is the rule."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In asymmetric FGR, the 'brain sparing phenomenon' occurs, where blood flow is redirected to maintain brain and heart perfusion at the expense of other organs, resulting in a preserved head circumference."

        "Fetal bradycardia in response to uterine contractions.",
        "Fetal distress."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A normal, reactive Non-Stress Test (NST) shows FHR accelerations of >15 bpm, lasting >15 seconds, occurring with each fetal movement. This indicates a healthy fetal response."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An acceleration of >15 bpm for >15 seconds is the definition of a reactive (reassuring) pattern on a CTG. A baseline of 100 bpm is bradycardia and variability <5 bpm is non-reassuring."

        "Fetal distress.",
        "Fetal congenital anomalies",
        "Head compression during labor.",
        "Insignificant, as tracing should not be evaluated during contractions.",
        "Cord compression."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Early decelerations mirror the uterine contraction, with onset at the start and recovery by the end. This is a normal physiological response to fetal head compression and does not indicate fetal distress."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "The patient has early decelerations (reassuring) but slow labor progression (1 cm in 2 hours). Artificial rupture of membranes (amniotomy) is an appropriate step to augment labor."

        "Normal in late 1st stage.",
        "Cord compression."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This describes late decelerations, where the FHR does not recover until after the contraction has ended. This pattern, especially with a drop to 80 bpm, indicates uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal distress."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "With severe, recurrent late decelerations indicating fetal distress, intrauterine resuscitation (left lateral position, O2 mask) should be initiated, followed by preparation for immediate delivery via emergency C-section."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A single late deceleration that resolves suggests a temporary issue. At 8 cm dilated, rupturing the membranes to augment labor while continuing close monitoring is a reasonable approach, provided the FHR tracing returns to normal."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Variable decelerations are not uniform in shape and are not consistently related to contractions. They are typically caused by transient umbilical cord compression."

        "Fetal biophysical profile."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "Decreased fetal movement count warrants further objective testing to evaluate fetal wellbeing. The fetal biophysical profile (BPP) is a standard test for this purpose."
