        "Loss of mid-trimester drop of blood pressure."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hypertension (HTN) during pregnancy is diagnosed when the systolic BP is 140 mm Hg or more and/or diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or more, measured at two occasions at least four hours apart in the sitting position."

        "Previous development of preeclampsia."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Primigravidas are a risk factor, implying that multiparity is not. Other risk factors include multifetal pregnancy, extremes of age, diabetes, obesity, chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, previous preeclampsia, and SLE. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) and polyhydramnios are also associated with conditions that are risk factors."

        "Toxins of pregnancy (toxemia)."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Chronic hypertension (C-HTN) is diagnosed before pregnancy or when hypertension develops before 20 weeks gestation. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia occur after 20 weeks gestation."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The only definitive cure for preeclampsia is termination of pregnancy. Once the placenta is delivered, most signs and symptoms of preeclampsia rapidly decline."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Normally, blood pressure drops slightly in the second trimester. A loss of this early drop is an abnormal sign that could alert for a higher risk of later development of preeclampsia. Other options are features of severe preeclampsia, not early alerts."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "With normal blood pressure (120/80) and only trace proteinuria, the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are not met. The cause of the headache and nausea is most likely non-obstetric."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The initial management of an eclamptic seizure is to protect the patient from injury (e.g., using a mouth gag to prevent tongue biting) and ensure a clear airway to maintain oxygenation."

        "Renal failure."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Preeclampsia is associated with placental insufficiency, which typically causes asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to the 'brain-sparing phenomenon'. Symmetrical IUGR is more often caused by early fetal insults like infections or chromosomal abnormalities."

    {
      "stem": "A 25 years old primigravida at 32 weeks gestation was admitted to ER due to eclamptic fits. Management should include:",

        "Hemoconcentration."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Preeclampsia is associated with generalized edema, hemoconcentration, and can progress to cause oliguria (decreased urine output). Polyuria (excessive urine production) is not a feature of preeclampsia."

      ],
      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "HELLP syndrome consists of Hemolysis (decreased red cell count), Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. Preeclampsia is associated with an elevated serum uric acid, so a decreased uric acid level would be an exception."

        "Hemolysis."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "During a normal pregnancy, plasma volume increases more than red blood cell mass, leading to physiological hemodilution, which is the most common cause of a decreased hematocrit."
