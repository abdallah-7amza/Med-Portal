      "explanation": "In the active phase of the first stage of labor, the rate of cervical dilatation is stated as 1.2 cm/hour in primigravidas (PGDA). While 1 cm/hour is a slight approximation, it is the most accurate statement among the given options, as the active phase starts at 4 cm, the rate for multigravidas is 1.5 cm/hour, and the third stage is 10-30 minutes."

      "correct": 4,
      "explanation": "During labor, station 0 indicates that the head is engaged, with the biparietal diameter (BPD) passing the plane of the pelvic inlet and the vault felt at the ischial spines. Therefore, a positive station such as (+1) signifies further descent, meaning the biparietal diameter is below the level of the pelvic inlet."

      "explanation": "When auscultating the maternal abdomen during pregnancy or labor, maternal heart sounds are not typically heard as a distinct finding in the way fetal heart sounds, umbilical vessel pulsations (funic souffle), uterine vessel pulsations (uterine souffle), or maternal intestinal sounds might be. Maternal heart sounds are usually assessed directly over the chest."
