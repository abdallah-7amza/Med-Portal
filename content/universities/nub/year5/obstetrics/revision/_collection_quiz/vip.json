      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "An intrauterine pregnancy should typically be visible on transvaginal ultrasound when hCG levels reach 1500 IU/mL. Since the level is below this 'discriminatory zone,' it's necessary to repeat the hCG level after 48 hours to check for the appropriate doubling time of a viable intrauterine pregnancy."

        "Genital tract laceration"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If postpartum hemorrhage occurs while the uterus is firmly contracted, the cause is likely traumatic (e.g., a cervical, vaginal, or perineal laceration) rather than atonic (a soft, boggy uterus) or from retained products."

        "Application of forceps"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When the fetal head fails to rotate from an OP position and descent arrests (deep transverse arrest), labor becomes obstructed. A Cesarean section is often the safest mode of delivery."
