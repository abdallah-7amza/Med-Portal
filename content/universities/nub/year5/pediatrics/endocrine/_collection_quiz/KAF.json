    {
      "stem": "The mother of a 2 week old infant received a letter reporting that her newborn screen is abnormal indicating possible congenital hypothyroidism. The tests are repeated and proved low T4 and high TSH. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach at this point?",
      "options": [
        "Begin sodium L-thyroxine therapy",
        "Close follow-up",
        "Serum for maternal antithyroid antibodies",
        "Thyroid ultrasound and scan"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The neonatal thyroid screening program is designed to prevent mental retardation in cases of congenital hypothyroidism. When a newborn screen is abnormal and is confirmed by a repeat test showing low T4 and high TSH, treatment should be initiated immediately with sodium L-thyroxine therapy to reduce the risk of impaired neurodevelopment."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Two months old female presenting with lethargy, poor feeding, abdominal distention and prolonged neonatal jaundice. The treating physician suspected hypothyroidism. Which of the following is consistent with this diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Bone age of 2 months",
        "Defecation more than 3 times/day",
        "Hemoglobin 12 g/dL",
        "Posterior fontanel 0.5 cm"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical diagnosis of a 2-month-old female with lethargy, poor feeding, abdominal distention, and prolonged neonatal jaundice points to congenital hypothyroidism. A posterior fontanel size of 0.5 cm is a normal finding at this age. Congenital hypothyroidism would be associated with a widely opened anterior and posterior fontanelle, constipation, and a low hemoglobin count."

    {
      "stem": "Day 7 old female neonate diagnosed on routine screening with primary congenital hypothyroidism. What is the expected hormonal profile?",
      "options": [
        "High TSH + High thyroxine",

        "Low TSH + High thyroxine",
        "Low TSH + Low thyroxine"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Primary congenital hypothyroidism is caused by a lesion in the thyroid gland. As a result, the thyroid gland produces low levels of T3 and T4, while the pituitary gland compensates by producing high levels of TSH."

        "High thyroxine level",
        "High serum bilirubin"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A neonate with primary congenital hypothyroidism may present with prolonged neonatal jaundice. Other laboratory assessments may show low T4 and high TSH. ACTH is not directly related to thyroid function."

        "Random blood glucose >200 mg/dL with the presence of diabetes symptoms"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus include a random blood glucose level of ≥200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia. Fasting blood glucose of ≥126 mg/dL is also a criterion. Metabolic acidosis is a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis, not a diagnostic criterion for diabetes itself."

        "Subnormal mentality",
        "Tall stature with preservation of infantile proportions"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Thyroid hormones are crucial for the growth and development of the brain, and their deficiency in early life can cause irreversible brain damage and mental retardation. Therefore, an infant who misses neonatal screening and has a late diagnosis of hypothyroidism is likely to develop subnormal mentality."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A 6-year-old boy with rapid breathing and vomiting, along with a special breath odor (acetone odor), is likely in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The deep rapid breathing is a sign of metabolic acidosis, so a blood gas analysis is the most important investigation to confirm the acidosis."

        "IV infusion of long-acting insulin and glucose 5% infusion"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A child presenting with dehydration, abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, high blood glucose (500 mg%), and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.15, HCO3 9 mmol/L) is in diabetic ketoacidosis. The first step in management is fluid replacement with normal saline. Insulin therapy is started after resuscitation, after one hour from fluid therapy, and continuous low-dose intravenous infusion of short-acting insulin is used."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A 6-year-old child with respiratory distress and acidotic breathing is likely to have diabetic ketoacidosis. A history of secondary nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) is a common symptom of diabetes mellitus due to polyuria."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A child with acidotic breathing, moderate dehydration, ketonemia, and high blood sugar is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The first step in therapy is fluid replacement with saline to correct the dehydration and hypovolemia."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Long-term diabetic complications include microvasculopathy, which affects the small blood vessels and can lead to retinopathy, sensory and autonomic neuropathy, and nephropathy. Low HbA1c is associated with a decreased risk of complications."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "For the nutritional management of diabetes, a healthy diet is recommended, with complex carbohydrates preferred over simple ones, as they provide a sustained release of glucose. Plant fats and oils are preferred over animal fats. Proteins should constitute about 15% of the total caloric requirement, not 30-35%."

        "Slow correction of fluid deficit"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cerebral edema is a major complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). One of the risk factors for its development is the rapid correction of hyper-osmolality. Correction of fluid deficit and blood glucose should be gradual to avoid this complication."

Her mother has noticed that her shoe size has not changed over the last 2 years. On examination: weight 75th centile, height at 25th centile; pulse 60/m. Abdominally she has palpable fecal mass. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",

      "explanation": "The boy's history of polyuria and weight loss over the past two months, combined with the acute symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and deep rapid breathing (Kussmaul breathing) on examination, strongly suggests diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). These acute symptoms represent the metabolic derangement resulting from uncontrolled diabetes."

      "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component. There is a known association between type 1 diabetes and susceptibility genes related to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in chromosome 6. It is not associated with marked insulin resistance (that is Type 2), and it is triggered by environmental factors, not necessarily infectious agents like diphtheria.
