      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture described, including a flat face, flattened occiput, epicanthal folds, hypotonia, and abdominal distention, are classic characteristic features of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). While other syndromes might present with some of these signs, this specific combination is most indicative of Down syndrome."

      "explanation": "Down syndrome is characterized by several clinical features and associated anomalies. Among the neurological features, generalized hypotonia in the first two years of life is a key characteristic. While cardiac defects are common, affecting about 40% of cases, and duodenal atresia is also an associated anomaly, generalized hypotonia is a constant and prominent feature."

      "explanation": "The clinical features of Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) include low birth weight, microcephaly with a prominent occiput, small ears, and overlapping fingers (clenched fist). The presentation of a small-for-gestational-age infant with a small chin, a clenched fist, and hypotonia is most consistent with this diagnosis."

      "stem": "During health supervision visit for a 5-year-old boy with hemophilia A, her mother reports that she herself is currently 16 weeks pregnant. She expresses concern about this pregnancy because her brother and two of her maternal uncles died from complications of hemophilia A. She was told at the time of her most recent ultrasonography that she is carrying a male fetus. What is the pattern of inheritance in this case?",

      "explanation": "Hemophilia A is listed as an example of an X-linked recessive disorder. The pattern of inheritance described—where the disease affects males (the son, brother, and maternal uncles of the pregnant woman) and is passed through the maternal line—is characteristic of an X-linked recessive condition."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents must be heterozygous carriers (phenotypically normal) for the abnormal gene to pass the disease to their child. In this scenario, since they have already had an affected child (who must be homozygous), both parents are confirmed carriers. The recurrence risk with each subsequent pregnancy for two heterozygous parents is 25% for an affected child, 50% for a carrier child, and 25% for a phenotypically and genotypically normal child."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of acute pallor and jaundice with severe anemia (Hb=3 gm/dl) and high reticulocytes suggests acute hemolysis. The history of eating family food yesterday suggests a potential dietary trigger for a condition like G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means family history, particularly in males (like a brother) and maternal lineage, is highly relevant. Given that it's a genetic disorder, parental consanguinity increases the risk of autosomal recessive conditions, and while G6PD is X-linked, a comprehensive genetic history is always prudent in these situations. Therefore, all these questions are relevant to reaching a diagnosis."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Endocardial cushion defect is a type of cardiac anomaly that is commonly associated with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), affecting about 40% of cases. The presence of growth retardation and dysmorphic features in a child with this specific cardiac history makes Down syndrome the most likely diagnosis."

        "Marfan syndrome",
        "Turner syndrome"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Brachycephaly (flat occiput) and intellectual delay are features of Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is a well-known associated gastrointestinal anomaly found in infants with Down syndrome and is often surgically repaired at birth. This constellation of findings strongly suggests Down syndrome as the diagnosis."

        "Examination of the tone.",
        "Inspection of the back.",
        "Palpation of the abdomen."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The double-bubble sign on an abdominal X-ray indicates duodenal atresia, a gastrointestinal anomaly associated with Down syndrome. The presence of a pan-systolic murmur suggests a cardiac defect, also common in Down syndrome. A critical feature of Down syndrome is generalized hypotonia, which would be an important part of the physical examination to support the suspected diagnosis."

        "Down syndrome",
        "Werdnig Hoffman disease"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Down syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by dysmorphic features and severe hypotonia. Persistent vomiting in an infant with Down syndrome can be caused by associated anomalies such as duodenal atresia. The combination of dysmorphic features, hypotonia, and early vomiting is highly suggestive of Down syndrome."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The presence of a systolic murmur and redundant skin of the neck (webbing of the neck) in a female infant is highly suggestive of Turner syndrome (45 XO). A common cardiac anomaly associated with this syndrome is coarctation of the aorta, which would manifest as a weak or absent femoral pulse."

        "This condition is transmitted as autosomal recessive"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Meningomyelocele is an example of a neural tube defect, which falls under multifactorial inheritance. This means its development is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Maternal supplementation with folate is known to significantly decrease the incidence of neural tube defects."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Turner syndrome (45,XO) is a sex chromosomal abnormality that affects females. A key feature is short stature, and a common associated cardiac anomaly is coarctation of the aorta, a type of aortic lesion. The patient's presentation of short stature and a history of surgery for an aortic lesion is classic for Turner syndrome."

        "Karyotyping for the infant only"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "While the risk of Down syndrome is dependent on maternal age, in younger mothers, a translocation form of Trisomy 21 is more likely. This translocation can be inherited from a parent who is a balanced translocation carrier. Therefore, karyotyping is needed for both the infant to confirm the type of trisomy and for the mother to rule out if she is a carrier of a balanced translocation, which would significantly affect the recurrence risk for future pregnancies."

An affected father will pass his single X chromosome to all of his daughters, making all of them affected. He cannot pass the trait to his sons, as they inherit his Y chromosome. An affected mother (who is heterozygous) has a 50% chance of passing the dominant X chromosome to either her sons or daughters."
