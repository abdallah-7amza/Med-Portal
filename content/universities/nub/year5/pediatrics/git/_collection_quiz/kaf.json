      "stem": "A 2-year-old child presents with severe episodes of intermittent colicky abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding per rectum. There was a recent history of an attack of diarrhea. A tubular mass is palpated in the right lower quadrant. To reach the diagnosis you should request:",
      "options": [
        "Abdominal US",
        "Barium follow-through",
        "Lower endoscopy",
        "Upper endoscopy"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a 2-year-old with severe, colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and bleeding per rectum, particularly after a history of diarrhea, along with a palpable tubular mass, is highly suggestive of intussusception. An abdominal ultrasound (US) is the diagnostic investigation of choice for this condition."

      "stem": "A 2-year-old child presents with gastroenteritis and moderate dehydration. Serum sodium is 165 mEq/L. In this type of dehydration, which of the following is an expected finding?",
      "options": [
        "Markedly sunken anterior fontanel",
        "Moist oral mucous membranes",
        "Polyuria",
        "Very dry tongue"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A serum sodium level of 165 mEq/L indicates hypernatremic (hypertonic) dehydration. This type of dehydration is characterized by water loss in excess of electrolyte loss, leading to a hypertonic extracellular fluid (ECF). This causes water to shift out of the cells, leading to cellular dehydration. The clinical signs of cellular dehydration include a very dry tongue and oral mucous membranes."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with signs of severe dehydration, including lethargy and decreased activity, a decreased number of wet diapers, and a history of vomiting and diarrhea. Severe dehydration is an indication for hospital management with intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Starting an IV line to correct dehydration is the most important initial step. Antidiarrheal drugs are contraindicated, and oral rehydration solution (ORS) is for mild-to-moderate cases."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient's pain is described as periumbilical, dull in nature, not severe, and a long duration without interference with daily activities, vomiting, weight loss, or other signs of organic disease. The physical examination and basic lab work (stool and urine analysis) are normal. These features are characteristic of dysfunctional recurrent abdominal pain (also known as psychogenic or nonspecific abdominal pain), which constitutes more than 90% of cases of chronic abdominal pain in children. The appropriate management is reassurance."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient has a history of watery diarrhea and dry mucous membranes, but is still alert and active, indicating she is likely in a state of mild-to-moderate dehydration. The most important line of treatment and the first step in managing a child with mild-to-moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORS). IV fluids are for severe dehydration or shock, while antidiarrheal drugs are contraindicated. Diet should not be restricted to clear liquids only; feeding should be resumed shortly after starting rehydration."

        "Flank pain",
        "Peri-umbical in site"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Dysfunctional abdominal pain is typically vague, dull aching in nature, periumbilical in location, and subsides in less than 20 minutes. Organic abdominal pain is often away from the umbilicus, and flank pain is a characteristic symptom of pyelonephritis, a potential organic cause of abdominal pain."

      "stem": "A newborn noticed to have chocking attacks immediately on starting bottle feeding associated with cyanosis. On examination his heart was normal, but his lungs show bilateral crepitations. After two days he was worse and hospitalized. CXR revealed aspiration pneumonia, and he was put on the ventilator. The next step to reach a diagnosis is:",
      "options": [
        "Arterial blood gases",
        "Barium meal",
        "Echocardiography",
        "Radio-opaque nasogastric tube"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Choking and cyanosis with feeding, along with bilateral lung crepitations and aspiration pneumonia, are classic signs of tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF) or esophageal atresia. The most common type is esophageal atresia with a tracheo-esophageal fistula. The key diagnostic step is to attempt to pass a nasogastric tube, which will be unable to pass to the stomach and will be seen coiled in the esophageal pouch on an X-ray."

        "Ringer lactate solution 20 ml/Kg over 16 hours"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "For moderate dehydration without shock, the first step is to correct the fluid deficit. The recommended fluid solution is glucose 5% and saline in a 1:1 ratio, and the deficit should be given over 6-8 hours. The dosage for shock therapy is a bolus of 10-20 ml/kg over 20-30 minutes, not 1 hour or 16 hours."
