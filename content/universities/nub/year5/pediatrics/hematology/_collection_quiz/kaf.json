      "stem": "An 8-year-old sickle cell patient arrives at the emergency room in respiratory distress. Over the previous several days, the child has become progressively tired and pale. The child's hemoglobin concentration in the emergency room is 3.1 mg/dl. Which of the following viruses commonly causes such a clinical picture?",
      "options": [
        "Coxsackie a16",
        "Echovirus 11",
        "Herpes simplex",
        "Parvovirus B19"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of progressive pallor and tiredness, along with a severely low hemoglobin concentration, indicate an aplastic crisis. In sickle cell patients, this is commonly caused by a parvovirus B19 infection, which targets red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, leading to a temporary cessation of erythropoiesis."

      "stem": "Two weeks after a viral syndrome, a 2-year-old child develops bruising and generalized petechiae, more prominent over the legs. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymph node enlargement is noted. The examination is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory testing shows the patient to have a normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood count and differential, the platelet count is 15,000/μl. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute leukemia",
        "Aplastic anemia",
        "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura",
        "Von Willebrand disease"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of a previously healthy 2-year-old child developing bruising and petechiae two weeks after a viral syndrome, along with a severely low platelet count of 15,000/μL and otherwise normal blood counts, is a classic presentation of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). The absence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymph node enlargement helps to differentiate ITP from other conditions like leukemia."

        "Is the child on any medication?",
        "What is the child's usual daily diet?"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A one-year-old boy with pallor and a low hemoglobin count, with otherwise normal growth and physical findings, likely has iron deficiency anemia. This condition in toddlers is often related to diet, such as a high intake of milk and low intake of iron-rich foods. Therefore, asking about the child's daily diet is the most helpful question."
