# Jaundice in Newborns

Neonatal jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby due to high bilirubin levels. It is one of the most common conditions requiring medical attention in newborns.

## Main Causes

* **Physiological Jaundice:** This is the most common type, and it is considered normal. It occurs in more than 50% of newborns.
* **Pathological Jaundice:** This may be due to underlying conditions such as blood type incompatibility, liver disease, or certain genetic syndromes.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is typically made through a physical examination and can be confirmed by measuring the bilirubin level in the blood or through the skin.
