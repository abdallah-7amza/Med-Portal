      "stem": "A 2-hour-old full-term neonate is noted by the nurses to have episodes of cyanosis. When they try to feed him, his oxygen level drops to 60%. But when he is stimulated and cries, his oxygen levels increases above 90%. Which of the following should be done to diagnose this case?",
      "options": [
        "Bronchoscopic evaluation of palate and larynx.",
        "Echocardiogram",
        "Hemoglobin electrophoresis",
        "Passage of catheter into nose"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of cyanosis that worsens with feeding and improves when crying are classic signs of bilateral choanal atresia. This is a condition where the posterior nares are obstructed, and infants are obligate nasal breathers. The most helpful diagnostic test is the inability to pass a suction catheter through the nares into the nasopharynx."

      "stem": "A full-term male infant is delivered by an emergency caesarean section for fetal distress. At birth, the boy is limp, cyanotic, and has no respiratory effort. He is dried, suctioned, and stimulated. However, no clinical improvement is noted. His heart rate is 60/minute. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": [

        "Chest compression",
        "Endotracheal intubation",
        "Free-flow oxygen"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The initial steps of neonatal resuscitation have been performed. The baby's heart rate is below 100 bpm, and there is no respiratory effort, which is an indication for positive pressure ventilation (PPV). PPV should be initiated immediately, starting with bag-and-mask ventilation."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A physiological weight loss of up to 10% of birth weight is expected during the first 3-7 days of life. This infant has lost approximately 6% of her birth weight, which is within the normal range. The appropriate action is to reassure the mother and encourage her to continue breastfeeding."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This infant is large for gestational age (LGA) and born to a mother with poorly controlled diabetes. Infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at high risk for hypoglycemia after birth. Monitoring the baby's serum glucose level is the most important initial step."

Maternal blood group is B positive while his blood group is O positive. On examination he is jaundiced, pale but is alert and active. Which of the following is the most likely cause of jaundice in this baby?",
      "options": [
        "ABO incompatibility",
        "Breast milk jaundice",
        "G6PD deficiency",
        "Physiological jaundice"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Jaundice appearing at 20 hours is pathological. G6PD deficiency is a common cause of severe neonatal jaundice leading to hemolysis, especially in certain ethnic groups. ABO incompatibility is less likely here as it typically occurs when the mother is type O and the baby is A or B."

      "stem": "A 2.5kg male neonate presents with respiratory distress at 18 hours after birth. Pregnancy was uncomplicated but the mother had premature rupture of membranes for 20 hours before labor and did not receive parenteral antibiotics. The baby required intubation and mechanical ventilation. What is the most probable cause for respiratory distress in this neonate?",

        "Discontinue chest compression",
        "Discontinue positive pressure ventilation",
        "Remove the ETT"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Chest compressions are indicated when the heart rate is below 60 bpm. Once the heart rate increases to over 60 bpm, chest compressions can be stopped. However, positive pressure ventilation should be continued until the heart rate is above 100 bpm and the baby has effective spontaneous breathing."

        "Warm, dry, stimulate, positioning & suction",
        "Initiate bag-mask ventilation",
        "Insert an umbilical catheter and administer naloxone"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The initial management steps for any newborn who is not vigorous at birth are to warm, dry, stimulate, and position the airway, followed by suctioning if needed. This is the first block of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) flowchart."

      "options": [
        "Administer sodium bicarbonate",
        "Continue bag/mask ventilation at a rate of 20 to 40 breaths/min",
        "Continue ventilation and begin chest compressions",
        "Observe for spontaneous respiration and withdraw PPV gradually"

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The baby's heart rate has increased to 100 bpm after 30 seconds of bag-and-mask ventilation, indicating a successful response. The next step is to observe for the onset of effective spontaneous respiration. Once established, PPV can be gradually withdrawn."

        "Provide positive pressure ventilation",
        "Warm, dry, stimulate, positioning & suction"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Current NRP guidelines recommend the same initial steps for all newborns, regardless of meconium staining: warm, dry, stimulate, and position the airway, followed by suctioning only if needed. Routine endotracheal suctioning for meconium is no longer recommended."

      "options": [
        "Intubate the trachea and suction",
        "Stimulate and initiate positive pressure ventilation",
        "Suction the oropharynx if needed",
        "Umbilical line placement"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The initial management of a newborn is based on their condition at birth, not the presence of meconium. The first steps are always warming, drying, stimulating, and positioning. If the airway is obstructed by secretions (meconium or otherwise), suctioning the oropharynx is indicated."

The initial heart rate is less than 100/m and positive pressure ventilation is delivered with bag mask ventilation for 30 seconds, however his heart rate remains less than 100/m. Which of the following does not contribute to the worsening of the baby's condition?",
      "options": [

        "Excessive neck flexion",
        "Head in midline position"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "When PPV is ineffective, corrective steps (MR. SOPA) are needed. Anatomic obstruction, a poor mask seal, and excessive neck flexion can all cause ineffective ventilation. A neutral head position in the midline is the correct positioning and would not worsen the baby's condition."

        "O-negative blood",
        "Residual placental blood"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The infant is in hypovolemic shock due to blood loss. A 10% dextrose solution is hypotonic and not a suitable volume expander as it won't stay in the intravascular space. Normal saline, O-negative packed red blood cells, and placental blood are all appropriate choices."
