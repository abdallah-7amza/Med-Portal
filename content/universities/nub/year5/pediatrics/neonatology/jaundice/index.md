# Neonatal Jaundice

Neonatal jaundice is the yellowing of the skin and the white part of the eye (sclera) in a newborn baby, caused by a high level of bilirubin in the blood (Hyperbilirubinemia). It is one of the most common conditions requiring medical attention in this age group.

## Types of Neonatal Jaundice

It can be broadly classified into two types:

### 1. Physiological Jaundice
This is the most common type and is considered largely normal. It occurs in more than 50% of newborns.
* **Cause:** The newborn's liver is not fully mature, which reduces its ability to process bilirubin effectively.
* **Onset:** It typically begins on the second or third day after birth, peaks between the third and fifth days, and then gradually disappears.

### 2. Pathological Jaundice
This is the type that warrants concern and investigation, as it results from an underlying medical condition.
* **Warning Signs:**
    * Appearance of jaundice within the first 24 hours of the newborn's life.
    * A rapid and persistent rise in bilirubin levels.
    * Prolonged duration (lasting more than two weeks).
    * May be accompanied by other symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, or pale stools.

* **Common Causes:**
    * **Blood group incompatibility (ABO/Rh incompatibility):** Leads to the rapid breakdown of red blood cells.
    * **G6PD enzyme deficiency (Favism):** Makes red blood cells more susceptible to breakdown.
    * **Neonatal Sepsis.**
    * **Liver disease or biliary atresia.**

## Diagnosis and Assessment

1.  **Clinical Examination:** Observing the color of the baby's skin and the whites of their eyes.
2.  **Bilirubin Level Measurement:**
    * **Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB):** A simple device placed on the baby's skin.
    * **Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB):** This is the most accurate measurement, obtained by taking a blood sample.

## Treatment

The goal of treatment is to lower the bilirubin level to prevent it from reaching the brain and causing serious complications (Kernicterus).

* **Phototherapy:** This is the most common treatment, where the baby is exposed to special blue light that helps break down bilirubin in the skin into substances the body can easily eliminate.
* **Exchange Transfusion:** This is reserved for very severe cases that do not respond to phototherapy, where the baby's blood is gradually replaced with donor blood.
