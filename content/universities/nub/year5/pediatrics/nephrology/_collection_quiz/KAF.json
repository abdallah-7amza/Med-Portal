      "stem": "Six years old male presenting to the OP clinic by generalized edema which is more apparent in the morning. Which of the following is not an expected finding?",
      "options": [
        "Abdominal pain",
        "Ascites",
        "Infection",
        "Polyuria"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's presentation of generalized edema, more apparent in the morning, with normal vital signs, is typical of nephrotic syndrome. In this condition, patients develop oliguria due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, not polyuria. The other options, such as abdominal pain from ascites and a high risk of infection, are recognized complications of nephrotic syndrome."

    {
      "stem": "A 5-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, vomiting and dysuria. On examination, she has suprapubic tenderness. What is the best way to collect a urine sample?",
      "options": [
        "Clean catch",
        "Suprapubic aspirate",
        "Urine bag",
        "Urinary catheter"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient is a 5-year-old girl, which is within the age group of toilet-trained children. The textbook states that midstream urine collection, or 'clean catch,' is the appropriate method for obtaining a urine sample in this group of children. Suprapubic aspiration and bladder catheterization are more invasive methods, while a urine bag is associated with a high risk of contamination."

    {
      "stem": "A 4 years old male presenting to the OP clinic by dark-colored urine following URTI. Which of the following is not consistent with the diagnosis of post streptococcal GN?",
      "options": [
        "Normal C3",
        "Impaired renal function",
        "Lower limb edema",
        "BP > 150/100"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of dark-colored urine following an upper respiratory tract infection is highly suggestive of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). This condition is characterized by a decrease in C3 complement levels, which typically return to normal within 8 weeks. Therefore, a normal C3 level would be inconsistent with this diagnosis. The other options, including impaired renal function, lower limb edema, and hypertension, are all consistent clinical features of APSGN."

    {
      "stem": "A 10-year-old girl presents with complaints of dysuria, lower abdominal pain and gross hematuria for the last 2 days. She has no complaints of fever or flank pain. Her urinalysis demonstrates > 100 white blood cells per high-power field, 10 to 50 red blood cells/HPF. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute pyelonephritis",
        "Cystitis",
        "Hemoglobinuria",
        "IgA nephropathy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of dysuria, lower abdominal pain, and gross hematuria without fever or flank pain are classic for lower urinary tract infection, or cystitis. The presence of a large number of white blood cells and red blood cells in the urine further supports this. Acute pyelonephritis, an upper UTI, would typically present with fever and flank pain."

    {
      "stem": "A 2-year-old boy presents with eye swelling and puffiness of the face. Neither jaundice nor cyanosis was noticed. Edema has been worsening over the past few days, and is most prominent in the morning. On examination his vital signs are normal. He has edema around the eyes, with scrotal enlargement. His abdomen is distended and dull to percussion. Nutritional history is optimum. What are the investigations needed to prove your diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Complete blood count",
        "Echocardiography",
        "Endoscopy",
        "Urine analysis and plasma proteins"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of periorbital and scrotal edema, ascites, and dullness to percussion, along with a history of optimal nutrition, strongly suggests nephrotic syndrome. The key laboratory findings to confirm this diagnosis are heavy-range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, which are assessed by urine analysis and plasma protein levels."

      "stem": "A 5 years old girl presenting with dark-colored urine and mild peri-orbital puffiness. You are suspecting post-streptococcal GN. The following investigation is not required:",
      "options": [
        "Complement (C3, C4)",
        "Kidney functions",
        "Urine analysis",
        "Urine culture and sensitivity"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of dark-colored urine and periorbital puffiness following an upper respiratory tract infection is a classic presentation of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. This is an immune-mediated condition and not a direct bacterial infection of the urinary tract. Therefore, a urine culture and sensitivity test is not required for diagnosis, although it may be done if a coexisting urinary tract infection is suspected. The other options, including complement levels (C3, C4), kidney function tests, and urine analysis, are all important investigations for confirming the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "This 5-year-old patient presents with classic features of nephrotic syndrome, including generalized edema, low serum albumin, high cholesterol, and proteinuria. The absence of significant hematuria, hypertension, or impaired renal function points toward minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children between 2 and 6 years of age."

        "CT abdomen",
        "Plain X-ray abdomen",
        "VCUG (Voiding cystourethrogram)"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "For a child presenting with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), the initial investigation of choice is an abdominal ultrasound. The purpose of this is to detect any underlying anatomical abnormalities such as obstructive uropathy that may predispose the child to recurrent infections."

      "stem": "Yousef is an 11 years old male presenting to the OP clinic by generalized edema which is more apparent in the morning. Serum albumin = 1.6 g/dL, cholesterol = 310 mg/dL, urinalysis revealed +++ proteins and RBC > 100/HPF. Serum creatinine is mildly elevated. Which of the following is the most probable pathological change?",
      "options": [

        "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",
        "Microangiopathy"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient is an 11-year-old male with nephrotic syndrome. Unlike minimal change nephrotic syndrome, this patient has significant hematuria (RBC > 100/HPF) and mildly elevated serum creatinine, suggesting renal impairment. This presentation is more consistent with a more severe pathological change, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is a common cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome."

      "stem": "A 10 years old boy suffered from acute tonsillitis two weeks ago. Now he complains of general weakness; edema of eyelids, headache, nausea and vomiting. Skin is pale, appetite is reduced, and daily urine output is 600 ml. Urinalysis: protein 1+, WBC 4-6/HPF, RBCs are too numerous to count. What is the most probable etiology?",
      "options": [
        "Genetic",
        "Immunological",
        "Infectious",
        "Malignancy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's history of tonsillitis two weeks ago, followed by symptoms of general weakness, edema, headache, and dark urine, is characteristic of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The pathogenesis of this condition is an immune-mediated response following infection with specific 'nephritogenic strains' of group A streptococci."

      "stem": "Treatment of this boy (Question 10) should include:",
      "options": [
        "Beta blockers",
        "Fluid balance",
        "Potassium therapy",
        "Tonsillectomy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The boy has acute nephritic syndrome, which is associated with oliguria and hypervolemia. The cornerstone of management is fluid balance, restricting fluid intake to prevent further fluid overload, heart failure, and hypertensive encephalopathy. The other options are either not indicated (tonsillectomy is a preventative measure for rheumatic fever, not a treatment for APSGN) or are not the primary, immediate treatment. Potassium therapy would be needed only if hyperkalemia is present, but fluid balance is a universal measure."

      "options": [
        "Group A beta hemolytic streptococci are responsible",
        "Hypertensive heart failure is a complication",
        "Steroids is the drug of choice",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of periorbital edema, dark urine, and hypertension following a suspected streptococcal infection is characteristic of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). The textbook states that supportive treatment, including fluid and salt restriction, and antihypertensives, is the main management, with complete recovery in over 95% of cases. Steroids are not mentioned as the drug of choice for APSGN."

        "Complement level is normal",
        "Renal functions are normal.",
        "Renal biopsy is indicated",
        "The commonest cause is minimal change nephrotic syndrome."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The child presents with classic signs of nephrotic syndrome: puffiness of the eyelids and pitting edema, with normal blood pressure. In this common age group (2-6 years), the most probable cause is minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), for which a renal biopsy is not routinely indicated. Biopsy is reserved for cases with atypical features such as gross hematuria, persistent hypertension, or an onset outside this age range. In MCNS, complement levels and renal functions are typically normal."

        "Heavy-range proteinuria",
        "High ASOT",
        "Normal Complement 4"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's history and symptoms are consistent with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). The presence of heavy-range proteinuria (albumin ++++) is an atypical finding and a poor prognostic indicator, as APSGN is typically associated with mild to moderate proteinuria. Gross hematuria, high ASOT, and normal C4 are all common findings in APSGN and do not indicate a poor prognosis."

      "stem": "A 5 years old girl presented to outpatient clinic with her mother complaining of abdominal pain almost every day. The mother reported a new onset nocturnal enuresis and the child is crying during urination. Pain is mainly suprapubic. A urine dipstick is positive for WBC, nitrite, leukocyte esterase and RBCs. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute cystitis",
        "Chronic constipation",
        "Glomerulonephritis",
        "Psychosocial problem"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The girl's symptoms of suprapubic abdominal pain, new-onset nocturnal enuresis, and crying during urination point towards a lower urinary tract infection (cystitis). The positive dipstick test for WBCs, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and RBCs strongly supports this."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The initial dipstick findings are suggestive of a urinary tract infection. The next most appropriate step, as stated in the textbook, is to perform a urine culture and sensitivity test to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism, which will guide antibiotic treatment."

      "explanation": "The patient has ascites and diminished air entry on the right side, suggesting pleural effusion. An intercostal tube with an underwater seal is used for purulent pleural effusion (empyema), which is a complication of bacterial pneumonia. This is not a standard treatment for pleural effusion secondary to nephrotic syndrome, which is managed with diuretics and albumin."

        "Mesenteric hypoperfusion",
        "Pyelonephritis"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient has nephrotic syndrome and is on steroid therapy, which increases the risk of infection. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain with diffuse tenderness is highly suggestive of bacterial peritonitis, a common and serious complication of nephrotic syndrome, especially in patients with ascites."

        "Low-molecular-weight proteins"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The filtration barrier of the glomerulus is designed to prevent the passage of high molecular weight substances like albumin. The ultra-filtrate is normally composed of water, electrolytes, creatinine, and low-molecular-weight proteins."

      "explanation": "Nocturnal enuresis can be a symptom of polyuria, and the textbook lists diabetes mellitus as a possible organic cause, especially new-onset enuresis in a previously toilet-trained child. The other statements are incorrect: enuresis is more common in boys, primary enuresis has a good prognosis, and a renal isotope scan is not a standard investigation."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Nephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable state due to several factors, including hemoconcentration, urinary loss of natural anticoagulants like antithrombin III, and increased hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins. Therefore, hemoconcentration is a correct factor."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The textbook mentions adenoid hypertrophy as a cause of nocturnal enuresis, likely due to sleep disorders. The other statements are incorrect. Primary enuresis is defined as bed wetting after the age of 5, has a good prognosis, and most children have a functional, not organic, cause."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The presence of RBC casts is a definitive sign of glomerular hematuria. Glomerular hematuria is also typically described as brown, smoky, or tea-colored urine, not bright red, and the red blood cells are dysmorphic due to their passage through the filtration barrier."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The pathophysiology section for nephrotic syndrome mentions that idiopathic nephrotic syndrome can be caused by T-cell dysfunction. The other options are incorrect: edema is due to hypoalbuminemia, not hypoglobulinemia; hepatic albumin synthesis is increased, and hypercholesterolemia is common, not hypocholesterolemia."
