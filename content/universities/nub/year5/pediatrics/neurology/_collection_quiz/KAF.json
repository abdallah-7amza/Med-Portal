      "stem": "A 15 months old boy presents with seizures associated with fever. He has been in good health except for a high fever that developed today (39.9 C). He has slight cough and mild nasal congestion. Just prior to the seizures he was playing with some toys. Past medical history is unremarkable. During examination convulsions completely stopped. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": [
        "Lower the body temperature",
        "Perform an EEG",
        "Perform CSF examination",
        "Start IV diazepam"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In cases of febrile convulsions, the immediate management priorities are supportive. This includes ensuring a patent airway, providing oxygen therapy, and using physical measures like tap water fomentations and antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol to lower the body temperature."

    {
      "stem": "A 4-yr-old boy is evaluated for his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which lasted more than 10 min. There is no history of illness or fever. Examination an hour after the seizure was completely normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",
      "options": [
        "Begin therapy with carbamazepine",
        "Order an EEG",
        "Order a CT scan of the brain",
        "Order an MRI study of the brain"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The prompt describes an unprovoked generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a 4-year-old boy. The clinical diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unprovoked seizures. A single unprovoked seizure in a child who is now normal requires investigation. The EEG is an important investigation in the clinical evaluation of seizures. It helps determine the location and extent of a structural lesion and can reveal associated malformations or brain atrophy."

      "stem": "A 5-yr-old child is referred with a 6 weeks history of morning headaches, often associated with vomiting. His parents have noted that during this period he has become irritable and moody. Which of the following would be the most likely to be identified during the physical examination?",
      "options": [
        "Marked elevation of blood pressure",
        "Papilledema",
        "Significant refractive error",
        "Tenderness on percussion of frontal sinuses"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of morning headaches and vomiting points to signs of increased intracranial tension, which is more common in older children after the closure of cranial sutures. Papilledema, or blurring of vision, is a late sign of increased intracranial tension."

    {
      "stem": "A 5-yr-old child has a 6-mo history of increasing difficulty in walking associated with urinary incontinence. Physical examination shows an alert child with increased deep tendon reflexes, clonus and bilateral Babinski reflexes in the lower extremities with grade 3/5 weakness symmetrically in all extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Guillain-Barré syndrome",
        "Medulloblastoma",
        "Myasthenia gravis",
        "Spinal cord tumor"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A spinal cord tumor is a possible cause of progressive motor weakness. The clinical picture of spinal cord lesions includes hypertonia and hyperreflexia, which are characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions. Spinal cord lesions typically affect the lower limbs only and may be associated with other manifestations like urinary incontinence and sensory deficits."

      "stem": "7-month-old girl is presented to the emergency department with gradual onset of fever, lethargy, and irritability. Her immunizations are up to date. Examination reveals a febrile infant who does not interact with the examiner and cries inconsolably. A lumbar puncture is performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid shows increase lymphocyte, normal sugar and mild elevation of protein. What is the most likely etiologic agent for this condition?",
      "options": [
        "Enterovirus infection",
        "Group B streptococci",
        "Haemophilus influenzae type b",
        "Neisseria meningitides"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of fever, lethargy, and irritability, along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of increased lymphocytes, normal sugar, and mild protein elevation, is consistent with viral meningitis, also known as aseptic meningitis. Enteroviruses are the most common cause of viral meningitis."

      "stem": "A mother brings in her otherwise healthy 4-year-old son because he was unable to walk since this morning. He had an upper respiratory tract illness with a fever 1 week ago. On physical examination, the boy appears well, but he complains of leg pains bilaterally. Examination reveals bilateral weakness in the lower limbs. Which of the followings is most suitable investigation?",
      "options": [
        "lumbar puncture",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine",
        "Nerve conduction studies/electromyography",
        "X ray hip joints"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of a 4-year-old boy with a recent upper respiratory tract illness followed by bilateral lower limb weakness is suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The definitive diagnostic investigation for GBS is electromyography (EMG), which reveals a decreased nerve conduction velocity due to demyelination."

      "stem": "During the health supervision visit for a healthy 4-month-old boy, you note that his head circumference is 46 cm (>98th percentile) and his length and weight are at the 50th percentile. He has mild frontal bossing and widely split cranial sutures. The fontanelle is flat. Arm and leg movements, tone, and reflexes are normal. In reviewing prior growth parameters, you note that his head circumference was at the 75th percentile at birth and the 90th percentile at 2 months. Which of the following is the most diagnostic procedure?",
      "options": [
        "Electroencephalography",
        "Head computed tomography scan",
        "Head ultrasonography",
        "Lumbar puncture"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's head circumference is progressively increasing, suggesting hydrocephalus. The most important investigation for hydrocephalus is a CT scan, as it can show dilatation of the ventricular system. Head ultrasonography is also used, particularly for antenatal diagnosis, but a CT scan provides a more definitive diagnosis and is the most important imaging study."

      "stem": "A 4 year old boy's parents complain that their child has difficulty walking. The child rolled, sat and first stood at normal ages and first walked at 13 months of age. Over the past several months however, the family has noticed an increase inward curvature of the lower spine as he walks and that his gait has become more waddling. On examination, the child is oriented and interactive with the physician with an average body built. Enlargement of his calves has been noticed. What is the most diagnostic procedure?",
      "options": [
        "Echocardiography",
        "EMG",
        "Muscle biopsy",
        "Muscle enzymes"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical findings of a 4-year-old boy with difficulty walking, waddling gait, and enlarged calves (pseudo hypertrophy) are characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The diagnostic procedure for DMD is a muscle biopsy, which shows absent dystrophin."
    },
    {
      "stem": "The parents of a 3-year-old child are worried about the child's apparent clumsiness with frequent falls and a waddling gait. The child had normal development of motor skills during the first year of life and has normal language development. Which of the following is consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy?",
      "options": [
        "Female sex",
        "Gower sign",
        "Hypertrophy of the quadriceps",
        "Positive antinuclear antibodies in the blood"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects only males. It presents with a waddling gait and difficulty getting up from a sitting position, which is demonstrated by a positive Gower sign."

      "stem": "While at school, a 6-year-old boy is noted by his teacher to experience 10- to 20-second lapses in consciousness, sometimes with clonic movements of the face. His parents have not noticed this behavior at home. What is your diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Absence seizures",
        "Lack of concentration",
        "Partial seizures",
        "Psychic"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Absence seizures are characterized by a sudden cessation of motor activity or speech with a blank facial expression for 5 to 20 seconds, followed by a continuation of the original activity. These attacks can be triggered by hyperventilation. There is no aura before the attack and no postictal manifestations afterward."

      "stem": "A 9 year old girl is referred because of declining academic performance over the last 6 months. Her class teacher was concerned that she has been inattentive and disinterested. She often asks people to repeat what they have said. On examination she looks well. Which investigation is most likely to reveal the diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "CT",
        "EEG",
        "Hearing assessment",
        "MRI"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a child with declining academic performance, inattention, and frequently asking people to repeat what they have said strongly suggests hearing impairment. Hearing and vision assessments, including Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Visual Evoked Potential (VEP), are important investigations for intellectual disability and related developmental issues."

      "stem": "A 2-year-old boy brought by his parents with acute onset of high fever followed by convulsions, there is no history of headache or vomiting. On examination his temperature is 39.7, he is fully conscious with no convulsions, no neck rigidity but he has congested pharynx. What is the next step in the management?",
      "options": [
        "EEG",
        "Give antipyretic",
        "Give diazepam IV",
        "Perform lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's history is classic for a simple febrile seizure: a child between 9 months and 5 years old with convulsions at the onset of a rapid rise in body temperature due to an extracranial infection (congested pharynx) and no signs of central nervous system (CNS) infection or other seizure causes. Since the convulsions have already stopped, the immediate priority is to lower the fever with antipyretics and fomentations."

    {
      "stem": "A 4-year-old child falls from the back of a three-wheeled vehicle hitting his head. He experiences no loss of consciousness. In the emergency room he is alert and oriented. CT scan of the head was normal. What is the best step?",
      "options": [
        "Do spinal tap",
        "Perform fundus examination",
        "Reassurance, advice parent not do anything further.",
        "Repeat CT exam after 48 hours"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "While a CT scan was normal initially, repeat imaging after a period of observation is the best step to detect delayed intracranial complications that may not have been present at the first examination. This approach is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but it aligns with the principles of monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure after head trauma."

    {
      "stem": "A 6 month old boy is brought by his mother because he is floppy. He doesn't seem to be interested in reaching for toys. At 4 month old his head support was week and had a persistent Moro reflex. The most likely diagnosis is",
      "options": [
        "Astrocytoma",
        "Atonic cerebral palsy",
        "Down syndrome",
        "Werding Hoffman disease"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of a 6-month-old infant with hypotonia, head lag, and persistent primitive reflexes (Moro reflex) is suggestive of a floppy infant. Atonic cerebral palsy, a type of cerebral palsy, is characterized by a 'floppy infant'-like picture with severe hypotonia, although deep reflexes are preserved or even exaggerated."

      "stem": "A 9 year old child comes to the hospital with acute onset of generalized convulsions and disturbed conscious level. The parents didn't report any similar attacks before; on examination he has normal temperature and mild puffiness. What is your first step?",
      "options": [
        "Blood pressure measurement",
        "CSF examination",
        "CT scan",
        "Fundus examination"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient has new-onset generalized convulsions and disturbed consciousness. The mild puffiness mentioned in the clinical picture may be a sign of renal disease. Measuring blood pressure is crucial because hypertension can be a cause of convulsions and could lead to serious complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy. It is one of the essential vital signs to check in a clinical evaluation of a case of convulsions."

      "stem": "A 5 year old boy was brought to emergency room with intractable convulsions. His mother said that he was playing in the swimming pool just before his friends noticed convulsion and he never had such condition before. On examination he was in coma with dilated non-reactive pupils. Which of the following investigations you should start with?",
      "options": [
        "Blood sugar",
        "CT scan of the head",
        "Lumbar puncture",
        "Skull x ray"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The child presents with intractable convulsions (status epilepticus) and a history that doesn't immediately suggest a clear cause. Hypoglycemia is a metabolic cause of seizures and is a critical, rapidly treatable condition. Checking blood sugar is a fundamental and immediate step in the workup of a seizing child to rule out this emergent cause."

      "stem": "A five-year-old physically active boy developed sudden paralysis of his left arm and leg. His mother believed that he has poliomyelitis because she was not regular with his vaccination. On examination in the emergency room he showed spasticity and hyperreflexia on his left arm and leg. Cardiac examination revealed systolic parasternal murmur. What is your diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Embolic hemiplegia",
        "Hemiplegic cerebral palsy",
        "Poliomyelitis",
        "Post diphtheritic paralysis"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The presentation of sudden paralysis on one side (hemiplegia) is indicative of a stroke. The presence of a cardiac murmur suggests a cardiac lesion that could be a source of an embolus. This is a more likely diagnosis than poliomyelitis, which is characterized by flaccid, asymmetric paralysis. Cerebral palsy is a non-progressive deficit, and post-diphtheritic paralysis is a symmetric, descending paralysis."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The infant's presentation with fever, mottling of the skin, and slow capillary refill points to poor peripheral perfusion, which is a sign of shock. The presence of a bulging fontanelle and petechiae are also concerning signs that could be related to a severe systemic infection like meningococcemia, which can lead to shock and be fatal in hours."
