        "Continue breast feeding and add rice cereal to her diet"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A breastfed 3-week-old infant who has adequate wet diapers and stools and a normal physical exam, but has regained only 50 g of weight since birth, is demonstrating normal physiological weight gain for a breastfed baby, particularly after a period of initial weight loss. The most appropriate next step is to continue with exclusive breastfeeding, as the baby's feeding pattern and other indicators suggest sufficient milk intake. Supplementation is not indicated, as the infant is showing positive signs of adequate feeding and health."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Maternal hepatitis B infection and maternal smoking are not contraindications to breastfeeding. However, the textbook mentions that phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition that must be diagnosed and treated with dietary manipulation, such as a phenylalanine-free formula, to prevent intellectual disability. Therefore, a positive newborn screen for phenylketonuria is a contraindication to exclusive breastfeeding and requires a specific dietary intervention."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The infant's diet is low in calories (70 Kcal/kg/day) but has a normal protein content (15%). This is consistent with marasmus, a condition of protein-energy malnutrition characterized by a deficiency of both protein and energy. A key finding in marasmus is the loss of fat from the body, including the abdominal wall and buttocks."

      "stem": "A mother brings her 1-year-old boy for follow up. He is pale, on the 75th percentile for weight; otherwise he is completely normal. Which item in the history may explain the condition?",
      "options": [
        "Family history of chronic anemia.",
        "Family history bleeding disorders.",
        "Nutritional history with stress on the type of weaning food.",
        "Neonatal history"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A 1-year-old boy presenting as pale suggests anemia. Iron deficiency is the most common mineral deficiency, and cow's milk is a poor source of bioavailable iron. The type of weaning food can significantly impact iron intake and lead to iron deficiency anemia, which would explain the child's pallor."

        "Avoid excessive breast milk after 6 months",
        "Avoid introduction of cow milk except after the first year.",
        "Avoid the use of spoon in feeding the baby till after the first year",
        "Introducing any new food item should be after breast milk feed."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cow's milk is a poor source of bioavailable iron and should not be introduced in the first year of life. The instruction to avoid cow's milk until after the first year is the most important advice for a 5-month-old who is about to be weaned."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The 14-month-old boy is exclusively breastfed with no vitamin or mineral supplementation, and presents with a large head, distended abdomen, and recurrent chest infections. These are classical signs of rickets due to vitamin D deficiency. The recommended investigation to diagnose rickets is to measure serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels, as their balance is crucial for bone mineralization."

      "options": [
        "Low serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase.",
        "Normal serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase.",
        "Normal phosphorus, low serum calcium and high alkaline phosphatase",
        "Normal calcium, low serum phosphorus and high alkaline phosphatase."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The case describes an 18-month-old exclusively breastfed boy with delayed walking, a distended abdomen, and wrist thickening, all classic signs of rickets from vitamin D deficiency. In typical rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency, a common biochemical finding is a low serum phosphorus level and a high alkaline phosphatase level. Serum calcium is usually maintained within the normal range due to compensatory mechanisms involving parathyroid hormone."

        "Diabetic ketosis",
        "Hepatic rickets",
        "Renal rickets",
        "Rickets with Hypervitaminosis D"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The child's clinical picture of delayed walking, delayed dentition, recurrent chest infections, and a history of receiving 'several medications and injections' strongly suggests rickets. The new symptoms of constipation, vomiting, and polyuria are indicative of hypercalcemia, which can be caused by an overdose of vitamin D in an attempt to treat rickets. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is rickets complicated by hypervitaminosis D."

        "CSF examination.",
        "CT brain.",
        "Serum calcium."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "An 18-month-old exclusively breastfed boy presenting with convulsions, without fever, suggests hypocalcemic tetany as a complication of vitamin D deficiency rickets. This is because vitamin D deficiency can lead to low serum calcium levels, which can manifest as convulsions. Therefore, the most relevant investigation to explain the convulsions is a serum calcium level."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "An infant with a diet of 5% protein and 40% fat presents with lower limb edema. This is a classic presentation of kwashiorkor, which is caused by protein deficiency. A hallmark of this condition is hypoalbuminemia (low serum protein) leading to edema. Hypernatremia can also be a metabolic complication in cases of protein-energy malnutrition."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The infant's low birth weight and current weight being less than the 5th percentile, along with an inadequate feeding regimen of 60 ml of formula every 4 hours, point to severe malnutrition. The clinical picture of poor growth and insufficient caloric intake is characteristic of marasmus, which is defined by a severe loss of subcutaneous fat, particularly from the abdomen and buttocks."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with delayed walking, which is a sign of rickets, and a history of multiple injections. The new onset of vomiting, constipation, and polyuria suggests hypercalcemia, a side effect of aggressive treatment for rickets, likely with high-dose vitamin D and/or calcium. Hypercalcemia can lead to nephrocalcinosis, which would appear as multiple radio-opaque lesions on an abdominal X-ray."

        "Serum protein and lipids.",
        "Upper GIT endoscopy."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of edema and an enlarged liver are classic signs of kwashiorkor, a form of protein-energy malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is characterized by severe protein deficiency, which leads to hypoalbuminemia and edema, while the enlarged liver is often due to fatty infiltration. Therefore, assessing serum protein and lipids is the most direct way to investigate the underlying nutritional deficiency and liver pathology in this case."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The constellation of symptoms in the 3-year-old boy, including chronic diarrhea, recurrent chest infections, a large head, broad wrists, deformed thoracic cage, and a distended abdomen, points to a multi-system disease affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the skeletal system. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that can lead to chronic respiratory infections, malabsorption causing diarrhea, and failure to thrive. It is characterized by thick, viscous secretions that obstruct airways and exocrine ducts, leading to these chronic issues."
