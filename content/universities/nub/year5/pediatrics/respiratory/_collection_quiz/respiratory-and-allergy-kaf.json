      "stem": "A previously healthy 18-month-old infant has been playing alone away from his family. Then he suddenly develops coughing and choking which resolves in a few minutes. After a while, the patient appears to be normal except for audible wheezes with occasional cough. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this condition?",
      "options": [
        "Acute asthma.",
        "Croup.",
        "Epiglottitis",
        "Foreign body inhalation."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of a sudden onset of coughing and choking that resolves, followed by wheezing that doesn't respond to bronchodilators, is characteristic of foreign body inhalation. A foreign body in the airway causes a sudden onset of symptoms, and the wheezing is persistent and not relieved by typical asthma treatments, which would be expected if it were a foreign body causing a partial obstruction."

      "stem": "A previously well, 3 years old child visits his doctor because of a 2 day history of low grade fever, coryzal symptoms, and a one day history of dry cough. Physical examination reveals absence of respiratory distress and clear chest. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute bronchiolitis",
        "Acute bronchitis.",
        "Bronchial asthma.",
        "Pneumonia."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The symptoms described—low-grade fever, coryza (runny nose), and dry cough—are typical of the early 'catarrhal stage' of acute bronchitis. The absence of respiratory distress and clear chest on examination further support this, as a physical exam may be unremarkable in this early stage."

      "stem": "A previously well 1-year-old infant had a runny nose and sneezing and coughing for 2 days. Two other members of the family had similar symptoms. On physical examination, he is in moderate respiratory distress with nasal flaring and audible wheezing. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute bronchiolitis.",
        "Acute bronchitis.",
        "Asthma",
        "Epiglottitis"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Acute bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants under two years old. It often begins with mild upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose and coughing, and then progresses to respiratory distress with tachypnea, retractions, and expiratory wheezing. The history of similar symptoms in other family members suggests a viral cause, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common pathogen."

The mother describes the child as having very large, foul smelling stools for months. Which of the following diagnostic investigations is likely to result in the correct diagnosis of this child?",
      "options": [
        "CT of the chest.",
        "Serum immunoglobulins.",
        "Sweat chloride test",
        "Tuberculin test."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The combination of persistent cough, recurrent chest infections, poor weight gain, and large, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea) is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. The sweat chloride test is the essential diagnostic procedure for this condition, as patients with cystic fibrosis have abnormally high levels of chloride in their sweat."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The child's symptoms (night fever, chronic cough) and close contact with a person having a chronic cough, fever, weight loss, and hemoptysis strongly suggest pulmonary tuberculosis. The management of tuberculosis involves a combination of at least two to three first-line drugs for several months. Isoniazid and rifampicin are both first-line drugs for TB treatment."

        "Abdominal ultrasound.",
        "Chest X ray.",
        "Liver function tests"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation, including fever, cough, and tachypnea, along with specific findings on chest examination such as diminished breath sounds and bronchial breathing over a lung lobe, points to pneumonia. The pain in the abdomen may be referred pain from the inflamed pleura or diaphragm. A chest x-ray is the most important initial diagnostic investigation to confirm the diagnosis and determine the pathological type of pneumonia."

        "Antipyretics.",
        "Blood gases.",
        "Chest tube."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of a severe lower respiratory infection progressing to pleural effusion with a mediastinal shift indicates a serious complication, specifically empyema. The mediastinal shift suggests a large collection of fluid that is compressing the lung. The appropriate management for empyema is immediate closed drainage of pus using an underwater seal or continuous suction, which is done via a chest tube."

        "Complete blood count and differential",
        "Trial of Anti tuberculous drugs"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The patient's chronic symptoms—fever, weight loss, cough, and swollen, non-tender lymph nodes—are all classic signs of tuberculosis. A chest x-ray is a crucial radiological study for diagnosing pulmonary TB, which is the most common form of the disease in children. The chest x-ray can reveal signs of consolidation, effusion, or other lesions."

      "stem": "A 1-year-old presents with cough, fever and mild hypoxia. At the time of admission, he had evidence of right upper lobe consolidation on chest X ray. Blood culture reveals staphylococci. 20 hours after hospitalization, the child has acutely worsened over the previous few minutes with marked increase in work of breathing, increase oxygen requirement. Which of the following is the first action?",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The sudden worsening of a child with staphylococcal pneumonia, which is known to cause lung abscesses and pneumatoceles, indicates a potential complication. A complication like a tension pneumothorax or empyema could rapidly develop and cause severe respiratory distress. The first action should be to get a second chest x-ray to check for these complications, which would then guide immediate life-saving interventions."

        "The child is contagious.",
        "The child is probably infected with mycobacterium.",
        "The child was exposed to tuberculosis 2 to 5 days prior to the test",
        "The size of the induration is not large enough to require antimicrobial therapy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A tuberculin test result of 10 mm or more of induration is considered positive. A positive reaction in a child under 5 years old who is not vaccinated with BCG, or a strongly positive reaction (over 15 mm) in a vaccinated child, indicates a probable TB infection. In this case, a 12-mm induration in a 1-year-old child suggests a likely infection with mycobacterium."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of generalized urticaria, wheezing, and severe dyspnea developing rapidly after consuming a known allergen (peanut butter) are a classic presentation of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate emergency treatment with intramuscular epinephrine (adrenaline)."

      "stem": "A 10-year-old boy who was previously well presents with a 2-week history of malaise, headache, cough associated with pleuritic chest pain, and fever over the past 3 days. Five days of treatment with penicillin caused no improvement. He also suffers from earaches and a sore throat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Mycoplasma pneumonia.",
        "Pneumococcal pneumonia.",
        "Staphylococcal pneumonia."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Atypical pneumonia, such as that caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, typically presents with symptoms like prominent headache, low-grade fever, earache, and sore throat. The symptoms are often milder but more persistent than typical pneumonia, and the illness would not respond to penicillin, as it requires a different class of antibiotics like macrolides. The age of the child (10 years) also fits the typical demographic for this pathogen."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The combination of wheezing, coughing, and feeding difficulties from birth, along with a presentation that doesn't fit the typical course of other infections, raises suspicion for a chronic condition. While the child's weight is currently normal, the cough, wheeze, and feeding issues are characteristic of cystic fibrosis, which can also be associated with bronchiectasis and malabsorption leading to failure to thrive."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "This is a true conflict. The correct answer in the textbook provided is the sweat chloride test, as the clinical presentation (wheeze, coughing, feeding issues, foul-smelling stools) is classic for cystic fibrosis. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study may be performed in cases of aspiration, but it is not the most definitive diagnostic test for the cluster of symptoms presented. The most suitable investigation for a case of suspected cystic fibrosis is the sweat chloride test."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The history of recurrent pneumonia in an infant, especially in the absence of other clear risk factors, suggests an underlying chronic issue. Congenital heart diseases, particularly those with a left-to-right shunt (e.g., ventricular septal defect), cause increased pulmonary blood flow, leading to 'lung plethora' and an increased risk of recurrent chest infections. An echocardiogram is the diagnostic tool for congenital heart defects."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation with fever, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and diffuse crepitations on chest examination points to bronchopneumonia, which is bilateral, patchy, and often caused by bacterial or viral infections. A chest x-ray showing scattered infiltrates in multiple lung fields supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's age and the severity of the symptoms, hospitalization and treatment with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are the most appropriate management."
