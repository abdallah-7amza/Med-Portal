      "options": [
        "Isolated for 6 days from leaving",

        "Isolated until certificate becomes valid maximum 6 days"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The vaccination certificate for yellow fever becomes valid 10 days after vaccination. A traveler may be quarantined for up to 6 days to cover the incubation period of the disease until the certificate is valid."

      "explanation": "While primarily transmitted by Anopheles mosquito bites, malaria can also be transmitted through blood transfusions and from mother to fetus."

      "stem": "Chemoprophylaxis of malaria is given to:",
      "options": [
        "Inhabitants of endemic areas",
        "Contacts",
        "Visitors of endemic areas",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Chemoprophylaxis is primarily recommended for non-immune individuals, such as travelers, visiting areas where malaria is endemic."

      "stem": "In endemic areas, filariasis is prevented by:",
      "options": [
        "Vector control",

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A comprehensive approach including vector (mosquito) control, personal protection, and mass drug administration is used to prevent filariasis."

      "stem": "Yellow fever is a major zoonotic viral disease.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted from animals (primarily monkeys) to humans by mosquitoes."
    },
    {
      "stem": "Plague shows epizootic spread with rat fleas infection.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. An epizootic is an outbreak of disease in an animal population, which is characteristic of how plague spreads among rodents via fleas."
    },
    {
      "stem": "During the attack phase of malaria eradication, there is mass application of residual insecticides.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. The attack phase involves intensive measures like indoor residual spraying (IRS) to rapidly reduce malaria transmission."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "False. The most important preventive measures are controlling the rodent population and their fleas. The vaccine is no longer widely available or recommended."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "False. Immunity acquired from malaria exposure is partial and wanes over time if the person is no longer exposed to the parasite."
