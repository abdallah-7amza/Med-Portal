        "Young to middle-aged people",
        "Young and old to working-aged people"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "According to the provided answer key, the intended answer is 'Young to working-aged people', which specifically refers to the child dependency ratio. The total dependency ratio includes both young and old."

        "+60 years",
        "15-64 years"

        "Decreased",
        "Increased",
        "No change"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Doubling time is inversely related to the growth rate. A lower growth rate means it will take a longer time for the population to double."

        "Census",
        "Morbidity"

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Population projections are primarily based on future assumptions about fertility, mortality, and migration, not rates of illness (morbidity)."

        "High life expectancy and low infant mortality"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "High life expectancy (fewer deaths) combined with low infant mortality (more children survive) leads to the fastest population growth."

      "options": [
        "Large number of people in the younger ages.",

        "Roughly equal number of people in all age ranges",
        "Rapidly growing population"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This shape, known as a stationary pyramid, indicates a stable population with similar birth and death rates across age groups."

        "Birth rate",
        "Mortality rate"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "By convention, the male population is shown on the left side of a population pyramid, and the female population is on the right."

        "3.3%",
        "5.5%"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The rate of natural increase is calculated as (Crude Birth Rate - Crude Death Rate) / 10. So, (44 - 11) / 10 = 3.3%."

        "Slow growth",
        "Stability"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A wide base signifies a large number of young people, which is characteristic of a rapidly growing population."

        "No change"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A 'baby boom' creates a cohort that is significantly larger than those before or after it, resulting in a bulge that moves up the pyramid over time."

      "stem": "The rate of natural increase does not include the effects of immigration or emigration.",
      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. The rate of natural increase only considers births and deaths. The overall population growth rate includes migration."

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Using the Rule of 70, you can estimate doubling time by dividing 70 by the growth rate percentage (70 / 2 = 35 years)."

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. Stage 3 (Late Expanding) is characterized by death rates remaining low while birth rates begin to fall, slowing population growth."

      "options": ["True", "False"],

      "options": ["True", "False"],
