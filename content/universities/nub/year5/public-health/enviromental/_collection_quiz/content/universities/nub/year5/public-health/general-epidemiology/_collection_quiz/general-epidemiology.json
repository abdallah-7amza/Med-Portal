      "correct": 2,
      [cite_start]"explanation": "Actively acquired natural immunity develops when the body is exposed to a live pathogen, develops the disease (or a subclinical infection), and becomes immune as a result of the primary immune response. [cite: 24, 27, 113]"

      "correct": 0,
      [cite_start]"explanation": "Carriers are epidemiologically dangerous because they are asymptomatic and not easily identified, allowing them to spread the infection unknowingly within the community. [cite: 37, 38, 113]"

      "correct": 1,
      [cite_start]"explanation": "Segregation is the separation of individuals (contacts) who may have been exposed to an infectious disease from the general population, often by excluding them from public places like school or work, to monitor for illness. [cite: 56, 58, 113]"

      [cite_start]"explanation": "This is an example of seroprophylaxis (passive immunization), where pre-formed antibodies are given to prevent a disease from developing after a known exposure. [cite: 76, 77, 80, 113]"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "True. [cite_start]In biological transmission, the pathogen undergoes a part of its life cycle inside the vector (the insect), which is different from mechanical transmission where the insect is just a carrier. [cite: 100, 113]"
