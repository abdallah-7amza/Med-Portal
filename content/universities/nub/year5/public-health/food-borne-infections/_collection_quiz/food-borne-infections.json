        "Antibodies begin to rise on the 2nd day of the disease.",

      "correct": 3,
      [cite_start]"explanation": "A single Widal test is often not conclusive, especially in endemic areas. A rising antibody titer in paired samples is much more indicative of an active infection. [cite: 93, 97]"

      "correct": 2,
      [cite_start]"explanation": "To prevent the spread of typhoid, food handlers who are contacts must be excluded from work (segregated) and tested to ensure they are not asymptomatic carriers before they can resume their duties. [cite: 103, 105]"
