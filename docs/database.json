However, the text does not explicitly state that rupture due to difficult obstetric forceps is usually of the complete type. Traumatic ruptures from instruments can involve complex tears that may be incomplete or extend from the cervix. Other options are generally consistent with traumatic rupture: tears can extend from the cervix laterally, broad ligament hematoma can occur with lateral tears, combined abdominal-vaginal repair is often needed for extensive tears, and lower genital tract lacerations with severe vaginal bleeding are common with instrumental delivery."

This is an incomplete rupture that occurs at the lower segment CS scar and can indeed be detected accidentally during CS. Because the peritoneum remains intact and the fetus is contained, the baby is usually not as acutely affected as in a complete rupture. The term 'silent' implies that the clinical signs, including bleeding, are not typically marked or overt, making the statement that vaginal bleeding may be marked the exception for this type of rupture."

This means that preterm delivery is a circumstance where the cervix may be incompletely dilated, leading to a tear, rather than preterm labor itself being a predisposing factor inherent to the cervix, like rigidity or scarring."
