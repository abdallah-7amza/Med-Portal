It occurs in more than 50% of newborns.\n* **Pathological Jaundice:** This may be due to underlying conditions such as blood type incompatibility, liver disease, or certain genetic syndromes.\n\n## Diagnosis\nDiagnosis is typically made through a physical examination and can be confirmed by measuring the bilirubin level in the blood or through the skin.\n",
