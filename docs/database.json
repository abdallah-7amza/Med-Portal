It is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs.\n\n## Risk Factors\nThe primary risk factor for endometrial cancer is prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen. Key risk factors include:\n* Obesity\n* Nulliparity (never having given birth)\n* Late menopause\n* Diabetes Mellitus\n* Tamoxifen therapy\n\n## Clinical Presentation\nThe classic symptom is **postmenopausal bleeding**. Any bleeding after menopause should be investigated to rule out endometrial cancer.\n"

It is one of the most common conditions requiring medical attention in this age group.\n\n## Types of Neonatal Jaundice\n\nIt can be broadly classified into two types:\n\n### 1. Physiological Jaundice\nThis is the most common type and is considered largely normal. It occurs in more than 50% of newborns.\n* **Cause:** The newborn's liver is not fully mature, which reduces its ability to process bilirubin effectively.\n* **Onset:** It typically begins on the second or third day after birth, peaks between the third and fifth days, and then gradually disappears.\n\n### 2. Pathological Jaundice\nThis is the type that warrants concern and investigation, as it results from an underlying medical condition.\n* **Warning Signs:**\n    * Appearance of jaundice within the first 24 hours of the newborn's life.\n    * A rapid and persistent rise in bilirubin levels.\n    * Prolonged duration (lasting more than two weeks).\n    * May be accompanied by other symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, or pale stools.\n\n* **Common Causes:**\n    * **Blood group incompatibility (ABO/Rh incompatibility):** Leads to the rapid breakdown of red blood cells.\n    * **G6PD enzyme deficiency (Favism):** Makes red blood cells more susceptible to breakdown.\n    * **Neonatal Sepsis.**\n    * **Liver disease or biliary atresia.**\n\n## Diagnosis and Assessment\n\n1.  **Clinical Examination:** Observing the color of the baby's skin and the whites of their eyes.\n2.  **Bilirubin Level Measurement:**\n    * **Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB):** A simple device placed on the baby's skin.\n    * **Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB):** This is the most accurate measurement, obtained by taking a blood sample.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThe goal of treatment is to lower the bilirubin level to prevent it from reaching the brain and causing serious complications (Kernicterus).\n\n* **Phototherapy:** This is the most common treatment, where the baby is exposed to special blue light that helps break down bilirubin in the skin into substances the body can easily eliminate.\n* **Exchange Transfusion:** This is reserved for very severe cases that do not respond to phototherapy, where the baby's blood is gradually replaced with donor blood.\n* \n"
